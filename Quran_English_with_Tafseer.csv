The Opening,1,1,"In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful.",In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful
The Opening,1,2,"Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds,",In the Name of God the name of a thing is that by which it can be known. The Names of God exalted be He are the archetypal forms ṣuwar nawʿiyya whose specificities and ipseities hūwiyya indicate the attributes of God and His essence and which indicate by their very existence His countenance and by their individuation His oneness. For these are the outward manifestations through which He can be known; Allāh is a name for the divine essence qua essence absolutely without taking into consideration that it may be qualified by the attributes or indeed taking into consideration that it may not be so qualified; the Compassionate is the one who causes existence and perfection to flow upon all things in the measure that divine wisdom requires and to the capacity of the receiving entities qawābil from the outset of their creation; the Merciful al-Raḥīm is the one who bestows the spiritual perfection kamāl maʿnawī that has been earmarked for the human species in the end sc. in the Hereafter. It is for this reason that they say O You Who are the Compassionate One of this world and of the Hereafter yā raḥmān al-dunyā wa'l-ākhira but say O Merciful One of the Hereafter raḥīm al-ākhira the meaning then is in the perfect human all-encompassing form general and specific mercy which is the locus of manifestation of the divine essence and the greatest truth with the totality of attributes I commence and I recite. It Allāh is the Greatest Name of God. It is to this meaning that the Prophet's ṣlʿm alluded when he said 'I have been given the sum of all excellent speech sc. The QurÌān and have been sent to complete the noble character traits makārim al-akhlāq. For words constitute the realities ḥaqāÌiq of existents mawjūdāt and their concrete substances aʿyān just as Jesus peace be upon him was called a Word from God cf. 33945. The noble character traits are the perfections of these existents and represent their specifities constituting the sources of their the existents' actions in their entirety contained as they are in the comprehensive human microcosm kawn insānī. Herein lies a subtlety la?īfa namely that the prophets peace be upon them have made the letters of the alphabet analogous to the ranks of existents marātib al-mawjūdāt.
The Opening,1,3,"The Beneficent, the Merciful.",The Compassionate the Merciful that is to say the One who possesses ‘mercy’ which means to want what is good for those who deserve it.
The Opening,1,4,"Owner of the Day of Judgment,",Master of the Day of Judgement that is the day of requite the Day of Resurrection. The reason for the specific mention of the Day of Judgement is that the mastery of none shall appear on that Day except that of God may He be exalted as is indicated by God’s words ‘Whose is the Kingdom today?’ ‘God’s’ Q. 4016 if one reads it mālik as opposed to malik then this signifies that He has possession of the entire affair on the Day of Resurrection or else that He is ever described by this expression in the same way as He is described as ‘Forgiver of sin’ ghāfir al-dhanb. Thus one can validly take it as an adjective of a definite noun.
The Opening,1,5,Thee (alone) we worship; Thee (alone) we ask for help,You alone we worship and You alone we ask for help that is to say we reserve worship for You alone by way of acknowledging Your Oneness tawhīd and so on and we ask for Your assistance in worship and in other things.
The Opening,1,6,"Show us the straight path,",Guide us to the straight path that is ‘show us the way to it’. This is substituted by
The Opening,1,7,The path of those whom Thou hast favoured; Not the (path) of those who earn Thine anger nor of those who go astray.,the path of those whom You have favoured with guidance from alladhīna together with its relative clause is substituted by ghayri l-maghdūbi ‘alayhim not the path of those against whom there is wrath namely the Jews and nor of those who are astray namely the Christians. The subtle meaning implied by this substitution is that the guided ones are neither the Jews nor the Christians. But God knows best what is right and to Him is the Return and the final Resort. May God bless our master Muhammad (s) his Family and Companions and grant them everlasting peace. Sufficient is God for us; an excellent Guardian is He. There is no power and no strength save in God the High the Tremendous.
The Cow,2,1,Alif. Lam. Mim.,Alif lām mīm God knows best what He means by these letters.
The Cow,2,2,"This is the Scripture whereof there is no doubt, a guidance unto those who ward off (evil).",That meaning this Book which Muhammad (s) recites in it there is no doubt no uncertainty that it is from God the negation lĀ rayba fĪhi is the predicate of dhĀlika; the use of the demonstrative here is intended to glorify the Book. A guidance hudĀ is a second predicate meaning that it the Book ‘guides’ for the God-fearing namely those that tend towards piety by adhering to commands and avoiding things prohibited thereby guarding themselves from the Fire;
The Cow,2,3,"Who believe in the Unseen, and establish worship, and spend of that We have bestowed upon them;",who believe in that is who accept the truth of the Unseen what is hidden from them of the Resurrection Paradise and the Fire; and maintain the prayer that is to say who perform it giving it its proper due; and of what We have provided them that is of what we have bestowed upon them expend in obedience to God;
The Cow,2,4,"And who believe in that which is revealed unto thee (Muhammad) and that which was revealed before thee, and are certain of the Hereafter.",and who believe in what has been revealed to you namely the Qur’ān; and what was revealed before you that is the Torah the Gospel and other scriptures; and of the Hereafter they are certain that is they know it is real.
The Cow,2,5,These depend on guidance from their Lord. These are the successful.,Those as described in the way mentioned are upon guidance from their Lord those are the ones that will prosper that is who will succeed in entering Paradise and be saved from the Fire.
The Cow,2,6,"As for the Disbelievers, Whether thou warn them or thou warn them not it is all one for them; they believe not.",As for the disbelievers the likes of Abū Jahl Abū Lahab and such; alike it is for them whether you have warned them or have not warned them they do not believe as God knows very well so do not hope that they will believe read a-andhartahum pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second making it an alif instead and inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one or leaving this insertion; al-indhār ‘warning’ is to give knowledge of something and simultaneously instil an element of fear.
The Cow,2,7,"Allah hath sealed their hearing and their hearts, and on their eyes there is a covering. Theirs will be an awful doom.",God has set a seal on their hearts impressing on them and making certain that no good enters them; and on their hearing in which He has deposited something so that they cannot profit from the truth they hear; and on their eyes is a covering that is a veil so that they do not see the truth; and for them there will be a mighty chastisement that is intense and everlasting.
The Cow,2,8,"And of mankind are some who say: We believe in Allah and the Last Day, when they believe not.",The following was revealed concerning the hypocrites and some people there are who say ‘We believe in God and the Last Day’ that is in the Day of Resurrection because it is the very last day; but they are not believers the plural import of man in man yaqūl ‘who says’ is taken into account here as expressed by a pronoun hum that expresses this plural meaning.
The Cow,2,9,"They think to beguile Allah and those who believe, and they beguile none save themselves; but they perceive not.",They would deceive God and the believers by manifesting the opposite of the unbelief they hide so that they can avoid His rulings in this world; and only themselves they deceive yukhādi‘ūn for the evil consequences of their deception will rebound upon them as they are disgraced in this world when God makes known to His Prophet what they are hiding and they will be punished in the Hereafter; and they are not aware and they do not know that they are actually deceiving themselves mukhāda‘a although a third verbal form from khāda‘a actually denotes a one-way action such as when one says ‘āqabtu al-lissa ‘I punished the thief’ using the third verbal form ‘āqaba; the mention of ‘God’ in this statement is for rhetorical effect; a variant reading for wa-mā yukhādi‘ūna has wa-mā yakhda‘ūna.
The Cow,2,10,"In their hearts is a disease, and Allah increaseth their disease. A painful doom is theirs because they lie.",In their hearts is a sickness doubt and hypocrisy which ails their hearts debilitating them; and God has increased their sickness with what He has revealed in the Qur’ān since they disbelieve it; and there awaits them a painful chastisement because they used to lie read yukadhdhibūn to imply that they used to call the Prophet of God a liar or yakdhibūn to imply their mendacity when saying ‘we believe’.
The Cow,2,11,"And when it is said unto them: Make not mischief in the earth, they say: We are peacemakers only.",When it is said to them that is these latter ‘Do not spread corruption in the land’ through unbelief and hindering people from faith They say ‘We are only putting things right’ that is ‘we are not engaging in corruption’. God exalted be He refutes them saying
The Cow,2,12,Are not they indeed the mischief-makers ? But they perceive not. .,Truly a-lā ‘truly’ is for alerting intended emphatically they are the agents of corruption but they perceive this not.
The Cow,2,13,"And when it is said unto them: believe as the people believe, they say: shall we believe as the foolish believe ? are not they indeed the foolish ? But they know not.",When it is said to them ‘Believe as the people believe’ that is as the Companions of the Prophet s They say ‘Shall we believe as fools believe?’ that is as the ignorant do? No we do not follow their way. The exalted One refutes them saying Truly they are the foolish ones but they know this not.
The Cow,2,14,"And when they fall in with those who believe, they say: We believe; but when they go apart to their devils they declare: Lo! we are with you; verily we did but mock.",When they meet laqū is actually laquyū but the damma has been omitted being too cumbersome for pronunciation; likewise the yā’ is omitted because it is unvocalised and is followed by a wāw; those who believe they say ‘We believe’; but when they go apart away from them and return to their devils their leaders they say ‘We are with you in religion; we were only mocking them the believers by feigning belief.
The Cow,2,15,"Allah (Himself) doth mock them, leaving them to wander blindly on in their contumac",God Himself mocks them requiting them for their mockery leaving them that is giving them respite in their insolence that is in their transgressing the limits of unbelief; bewildered wavering in perplexity ya‘mahūn is a circumstantial qualifier.
The Cow,2,16,"These are they who purchase error at the price of guidance, so their commerce doth not prosper, neither are they guided.",Those are they who have bought error for guidance that is they have exchanged the latter for the former; so their commerce has not profited them that is to say they have gained nothing from it indeed they have lost because their destination is the Fire made everlasting for them; nor are they guided in what they did.
The Cow,2,17,"Their likeness is as the likeness of one who kindleth fire, and when it sheddeth its light around him Allah taketh away their light and leaveth them in darkness, where they cannot see,",Their likeness the way they are in their hypocrisy is as the likeness of one who kindled that is one who lit a fire in darkness and when it illumined all about him so that he is able to see and to feel warm and secure from those he feared God took away their light extinguishing it the plural pronoun in nūrihim takes into account the plural import of alladhī; and left them in darkness unable to see what is around them confused as to the way in fear; likewise are those who have found temporary security by professing faith but who will meet with terror and punishment upon death; these last are
The Cow,2,18,"Deaf, dumb and blind; and they return not.",deaf to the truth so that they cannot hear it and accept it; dumb mute as regards goodness unable to speak of it; and blind to the path of guidance so that they cannot perceive it; they shall not return from error.
The Cow,2,19,"Or like a rainstorm from the sky, wherein is darkness, thunder and the flash of lightning. They thrust their fingers in their ears by reason of the thunder-claps, for fear of death, Allah encompasseth the disbelievers (in His guidance, His omniscience and His omnipotence).",Or the likeness of them is as a cloudburst that is the likeness of them is as people are during rain ka-sayyib the term is originally sayyūb from the verb sāba yasūbu meaning ‘it came down’; out of the heaven out of the clouds in which clouds is darkness layer upon layer and thunder the angel in charge of them sc. the clouds; it is also said that this thunder is actually the sound of his voice; and lightning the flash caused by his voice which he uses to drive them — they the people under the rain put their fingers that is their fingertips in their ears against because of the thunderclaps the violent sound of thunder in order not to hear it cautious of fearful of death if they were to hear it. Similar is the case with these when the Qur’ān is revealed in which there is mention of the unbelief that is like darkness the threat of punishment that is like the sound of thunder and the clear arguments that are like the clear lightning they shut their ears in order not to hear it and thereby incline towards true faith and abandon their religion which for them would be death; and God encompasses the disbelievers in both knowledge and power so they cannot escape Him.
The Cow,2,20,"The lightning almost snatcheth away their sight from them. As often as it flasheth forth for them they walk therein, and when it darkeneth against them they stand still. If Allah willed, He could destroy their hearing and their sight. Lo! Allah is able to do all things.",The lightning well-nigh almost snatches away their sight that is takes it away swiftly; whensoever it gives them light they walk in it in its light; and when the darkness is over them they stop that is they stand still a simile of the perturbation that the Qur’ānic arguments cause in their hearts and of their acknowledging the truths of what they love to hear and recoiling from what they detest; had God willed He would have taken away their hearing and their sight that is the exterior faculty in the same way that He took away their inner one; Truly God has power over all things that He wills as for example His taking away of the above-mentioned.
The Cow,2,21,"O mankind! worship your Lord, Who hath created you and those before you, so that ye may ward off (evil).",O people of Mecca worship profess the oneness of your Lord Who created you made you when you were nothing and created those that were before you; so that you may be fearful of His punishment by worshipping Him la‘alla ‘so that’ is essentially an optative but when spoken by God it denotes an affirmative
The Cow,2,22,"Who hath appointed the earth a resting-place for you, and the sky a canopy; and causeth water to pour down from the sky, thereby producing fruits as food for you. And do not set up rivals to Allah when ye know (better).",He Who assigned to you created for you the earth for a couch like a carpet that is laid out neither extremely hard nor extremely soft so as to make it impossible to stand firm upon it; and heaven for an edifice like a roof; and sent down from the heaven water wherewith He brought forth all types of fruits for your provision; so set not up compeers to God that is partners in worship while you know that He is the Creator that you create not and that only One that creates can be God.
The Cow,2,23,"And if ye are in doubt concerning that which We reveal unto Our slave (Muhammad), then produce a surah of the like thereof, and call your witness beside Allah if ye are truthful.",And if you are in doubt in uncertainty concerning what We have revealed to Our servant Muhammad (s) of the Qur’ān that it is from God then bring a sūra like it that is also revealed min mithlihi min is explicative that is a sūra like it in its eloquence fine arrangement and its bestowal of knowledge of the Unseen; a sūra is a passage with a beginning and end made up of a minimum of three verses; and call your witnesses those other gods that you worship besides God that is other than Him so that it can be seen if you are truthful in your claim that Muhammad (s) speaks it from himself. So do this for you are also fluent speakers of Arabic like him. When they could not do this God said
The Cow,2,24,"And if ye do it not - and ye can never do it - then guard yourselves against the Fire prepared for disbelievers, whose fuel is of men and stones.",And if you do not do what was mentioned because you are incapable and you will not a parenthetical statement that is never will you be able to because of its inimitability then fear through belief in God and belief that this is not the words of a human the Fire whose fuel is men disbelievers and stones like their very idols indicating that its heat is extreme since it burns with the stones mentioned unlike the fires of this world that burn with wood and similar materials; prepared and made ready for disbelievers so that they are punished in it this phrase u‘iddat li’l-kāfirīna ‘prepared for disbelievers’ is either a new sentence or a sustained circumstantial qualifier.
The Cow,2,25,"And give glad tidings (O Muhammad) unto those who believe and do good works; that theirs are Gardens underneath which rivers flow; as often as they are regaled with food of the fruit thereof, they say: this is what was given us aforetime; and it is given to them in resemblance. There for them are pure companions; there for ever they abide.",And give good tidings to inform those who believe who have faith in God and perform righteous deeds such as the obligatory and supererogatory rituals that theirs shall be Gardens of trees and habitations underneath which that is underneath these trees and palaces rivers run tajrī min tahtihā’l-anhāru that is there are waters in it al-nahr is the place in which water flows and is so called because the water carves yanhar its way through it; the reference to it as ‘running’ is figurative; whensoever they are provided with fruits therefrom that is whenever they are given to eat from these gardens they shall say ‘This is what that is the like of what we were provided with before’ that is before this in Paradise since its fruits are similar and this is evidenced by the following statement they shall be given it the provision in perfect semblance that is resembling one another in colour but different in taste; and there for them shall be spouses of houris and others purified from menstruation and impurities; therein they shall abide dwelling therein forever neither perishing nor departing therefrom. And when the Jews said ‘Why does God strike a similitude about flies where He says And if a fly should rob them of anything Q. 2273 and about a spider where He says As the likeness of the spider Q. 2941 what does God want with these vile creatures? God then revealed the following
The Cow,2,26,"Lo! Allah disdaineth not to coin the similitude even of a gnat. Those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord; but those who disbelieve say: What doth Allah wish (to teach) by such a similitude ? He misleadeth many thereby, and He guideth many thereby; and He misleadeth thereby only miscreants;",God is not ashamed to strike to make a similitude mathal is the first direct object; mā either represents an indefinite noun described by what comes after it and constitutes a second direct object meaning ‘whatever that similitude may be’; or it the mā is extra to emphasise the vileness involved so that what follows constitutes the second direct object; even of a gnat ba‘ūda is the singular of ba‘ūd that is small flies; or anything above it that is larger than it so that this explanation is not affected by the size of the creature with regard to the judgement God is making; as for the believers they know it the similitude is the truth established and given in this instance from their Lord; but as for disbelievers they say ‘What did God desire by this for a similitude?’ mathalan is a specification meaning ‘by this similitude’; mā is an interrogative of rejection and is the subject; dhā means alladhī whose relative clause contains its predicate in other words ‘what use is there in it?’. God then responds to them saying Thereby that is by this similitude He leads many astray from the truth on account of their disbelieving in it and thereby He guides many believers on account of their belief in it; and thereby He leads none astray except the wicked those that reject obedience to Him.
The Cow,2,27,"Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever that which Allah ordered to be joined, and (who) make mischief in the earth: Those are they who are the losers.",Those such as He has described break the covenant of God the contract He made with them in the revealed Books to belief in Muhammad (s) after its solemn binding after it has been confirmed with them and such as cut what God has commanded should be joined of belief in the Prophet of kinship and other matters an in the phrase an yūsala ‘that it be joined’ substitutes for the pronoun suffixed in bihi of the preceding words mā amara Llāhu bihi ‘that which God has commanded’; and such as do corruption in the land by way of their transgressing and impeding faith they the ones thus described shall be the losers since they shall end up in the Fire made everlasting for them.
The Cow,2,28,"How disbelieve ye in Allah when ye were dead and He gave life to you! Then He will give you death, then life again, and then unto Him ye will return.",How do you people of Mecca disbelieve in God when you were dead semen inside loins and He gave you life in the womb and in this world by breathing Spirit into you the interrogative here is either intended to provoke amazement at their persistent unbelief despite the evidence established or intended as a rebuke; then He shall make you dead after your terms of life are completed then He shall give you life at the Resurrection then to Him you shall be returned! after resurrection whereupon He shall requite you according to your deeds; and He states as proof of the Resurrection when they denied it
The Cow,2,29,"He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth. Then turned He to the heaven, and fashioned it as seven heavens. And He is knower of all things.",He it is Who created for you all that is in the earth that is the earth and all that is in it so that you may benefit from and learn lessons from it; then after creating the earth He turned to that is He made His object heaven and levelled them fa-sawwāhunna the pronoun -hunna refers to ‘heaven’ since it heaven is implicit in the import of the sentence attributed to it the pronoun that is to say He made them thus as He says in another verse fa-qadāhunna so He determined them Q. 4112 seven heavens and He has knowledge of all things in their totality and in their individual detail so do you not then think that the One who has the power to create this to begin with which is much greater than what you are also has the power to bring you back after death?
The Cow,2,30,"And when thy Lord said unto the angels: Lo! I am about to place a viceroy in the earth, they said: Wilt thou place therein one who will do harm therein and will shed blood, while we, we hymn Thy praise and sanctify Thee ? He said: Surely I know that which ye know not.",And mention O Muhammad (s) when your Lord said to the angels ‘I am appointing on earth a vicegerent’ who shall act as My deputy by implementing My rulings therein — and this vicegerent was Adam; They said ‘What will You appoint therein one who will do corruption therein through disobedience and shed blood spilling it through killing just as the progeny of the jinn did for they used to inhabit it but when they became corrupted God sent down the angels against them and they were driven away to islands and into the mountains; while we glorify continuously You with praise that is “We say Glory and Praise be to You” and sanctify You?’ that is ‘We exalt You as transcendent above what does not befit You?; the lām of laka ‘You’ is extra and the sentence wa-nuqaddisu laka ‘We sanctify You’ is a circumstantial qualifier the import being ‘thus we are more entitled to be Your vicegerents’; He exalted be He said ‘Assuredly I know what you know not’ of the benefits of making Adam a vicegerent and of the fact that among his progeny will be the obedient and the transgressor and justice will prevail between them. They said ‘God will never create anything more noble in His eyes than us nor more knowledgeable since we have been created before it and have seen what it has not seen. God then created Adam from the surface of the earth adīm al-ard adīm literally means ‘skin’ taking a handful of all its colours and mixing it with different waters then made him upright and breathed into him the Spirit and he thus became a living being with senses after having been inanimate.
The Cow,2,31,"And He taught Adam all the names, then showed them to the angels, saying: Inform Me of the names of these, if ye are truthful.",And He taught Adam the names that is the names of things named all of them by placing knowledge of them into his heart; then He presented them these names the majority of which concerned intellectual beings to the angels and said to them in reproach ‘Now tell Me inform Me the names of these things named if you speak truly’ in your claim that I would not create anything more knowledgeable than you or that you are more deserving of this vicegerency; the response to the conditional sentence is intimated by what precedes it.
The Cow,2,32,"They said: Be glorified! We have no knowledge saving that which Thou hast taught us. Lo! Thou, only Thou, art the Knower, the Wise.",They said ‘Glory be to You! exalting You above that any should object to You We know not except what You have taught us. Surely You are innaka anta emphasises the preceding suffixed pronoun kāf the Knower Wise’ from whose knowledge and wisdom nothing escapes.
The Cow,2,33,"He said: O Adam! Inform them of their names, and when he had informed them of their names, He said: Did I not tell you that I know the secret of the heavens and the earth ? And I know that which ye disclose and which ye hide.",He exalted be He said ‘Adam tell them the angels their names’ all of the things named; so he named each thing by its appellation and mentioned the wisdom behind its creation; And when he had told them their names He exalted said in rebuke ‘Did I not tell you that I know the Unseen in the heavens and the earth? what is unseen in them And I know what you reveal what you manifested when you said ‘What will You appoint therein …’ and what you were hiding what you were keeping secret when you were saying that God would not create anything more knowledgeable or more noble in His eyes than us.
The Cow,2,34,"And when We said unto the angels: Prostrate yourselves before Adam, they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He demurred through pride, and so became a disbeliever..",And mention when We said to the angels ‘Prostrate yourselves to Adam’ a prostration that is a bow of salutation; so they prostrated themselves except Iblīs the father of the jinn who was among the angels he refused to prostrate and disdained became proud and said I am better than he Q. 712; and so he became one of the disbelievers according to God’s knowledge.
The Cow,2,35,"And We said: O Adam! Dwell thou and thy wife in the Garden, and eat ye freely (of the fruits) thereof where ye will; but come not nigh this tree lest ye become wrong-doers.",And We said ‘Adam dwell anta ‘you’ of ‘dwell you’ here reiterates the concealed pronoun of the person of the verb uskun so that it wa-zawjuk may be made a supplement to it; and your wife Eve Hawwā’ — who was created from his left rib — in the Garden and eat thereof of its food easefully of anything without restrictions where you desire; but do not come near this tree to eat from it and this was wheat or a vine or something else lest you be become evildoers’ that is transgressors.
The Cow,2,36,"036 But Satan caused them to deflect therefrom and expelled them from the (happy) state in which they were; and We said: Fall down, one of you a foe unto the other! There shall be for you on earth a habitation and provision for a time.",Then Satan Iblīs caused them to slip he caused them to be removed fa-azallahumā a variant reading has fa-azālahumā he caused them to be away from it therefrom that is from the Garden when he said to them ‘Shall I point you to the tree of eternity’ cf. Q. 20120 and swore to them by God that he was only giving good advice to them and so they ate of it; and brought them out of what they were in of bliss; and We said ‘Go down to earth both of you and all those comprised by your seed; some of you of your progeny an enemy to the other through your wronging one another; and in the earth a dwelling a place of settlement shall be yours and enjoyment of whatever of its vegetation you may enjoy for a while’ until the time your terms of life are concluded.
The Cow,2,37,"Then Adam received from his Lord words (of revelation), and He relented toward him. Lo! He is the relenting, the Merciful.",Thereafter Adam received certain words from his Lord with which He inspired him a variant reading of Ādamu has accusative Ādama and nominative kalimātu meaning they the words came to him and these were those of the verse Lord we have wronged ourselves Q. 723 with which he supplicated and He relented to him that is He accepted his repentance; truly He is the Relenting to His servants the Merciful to them.
The Cow,2,38,"We said: Go down, all of you, from hence; but verily there cometh unto you from Me a guidance; and whoso followeth My guidance, there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve.",We said ‘Go down from it from the Garden all together He has repeated this phrase qulnā ihbitū in order to supplement it with yet fa-immā the nūn of the conditional particle in ‘if’ has been assimilated with the extra mā there shall come to you from Me guidance a Book and a prophet and whoever follows My guidance believing in me and performing deeds in obedience of Me no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter since they will be admitted into Paradise.
The Cow,2,39,"But they who disbelieve, and deny Our revelations, such are rightful Peoples of the Fire. They will abide therein.",As for the disbelievers who deny Our signs Our Books those shall be the inhabitants of the Fire abiding therein’ enduring perpetually neither perishing nor exiting therefrom.
The Cow,2,40,"O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you, and fulfil your (part of the) covenant, I shall fulfil My (part of the) covenant, and fear Me.",O Children of Israel sons of Jacob remember My favour wherewith I favoured you that is your forefathers saving them from Pharaoh parting the sea sending clouds as shelter and other instances for which you should show gratitude by being obedient to Me; and fulfil My covenant that which I took from you that you believe in Muhammad (s) and I shall fulfil your covenant that which I gave to you that you shall be rewarded for this with Paradise; and be in awe of Me fear Me and not anyone else when you have abandoned belief in him the Prophet.
The Cow,2,41,"And believe in that which I reveal, confirming that which ye possess already (of the Scripture), and be not first to disbelieve therein, and part not with My revelations for a trifling price, and keep your duty unto Me.",And believe in what I have revealed of the Qur’ān confirming that which is with you of the Torah by its agreement with it in respect to affirmation of God’s Oneness and prophethood; and be not the first to disbelieve in it from among the People of the Scripture for those who will come after you will depend on you and so you will bear their sins. And do not sell exchange My signs those that relate to the description of Muhammad (s) in your Book; for a small price for a trivial and temporary affair of this world; that is to say do not suppress this for fear of losing what you hope to earn from lowly individuals among you; and fear Me and none other in this matter.
The Cow,2,42,"Confound not truth with falsehood, nor knowingly conceal the truth.",And do not obscure confuse the truth that I have revealed to you with falsehood that you fabricate; and do not conceal the truth the description of Muhammad (s) wittingly that is knowing it to be the truth.
The Cow,2,43,"Establish worship, pay the poor-due, and bow your heads with those who bow (in worship).",And establish prayer and pay the alms and bow with those that bow that is pray with those who pray Muhammad (s) and his Companions this was revealed concerning their religious scholars who used to say to their kin from among the Muslims ‘Stay firm upon the religion of Muhammad (s) for it is the truth’.
The Cow,2,44,Enjoin ye righteousness upon mankind while ye yourselves forget (to practise it) ? And ye are readers of the Scripture! Have ye then no sense ?,Will you bid others to piety to belief in Muhammad (s) and forget yourselves neglecting yourselves and not bidding them to the same while you recite the Book? in which there is the threat of chastisement if what you do contradicts what you say. Do you not understand? the evil nature of your actions that you might then repent? the sentence about ‘forgetting’ constitutes the syntactical locus of the interrogative of disavowal.
The Cow,2,45,"Seek help in patience and prayer; and truly it is hard save for the humble-minded,",Seek help ask for assistance in your affairs in patience by restraining the soul in the face of that which it dislikes; and prayer. The singling out of this for mention is a way of emphasising its great importance; in one hadīth it is stated ‘When something bothered the Prophet s he would immediately resort to prayer’; it is said that the address here is to the Jews when greed and desire for leadership became impediments to their faith they were enjoined to forbearance which constituted fasting and prayer since the former stems from lust and the latter yields humility and negates pride. For it prayer is grievous burdensome except to the humble those that are at peace in obedience
The Cow,2,46,"Who know that they will have to meet their Lord, and that unto Him they are returning.",who reckon who are certain that they shall meet their Lord at the Resurrection and that to Him they are returning in the Hereafter where He will reward them.
The Cow,2,47,O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and how I preferred you to (all) creatures.,O Children of Israel remember My favour wherewith I favoured you by giving thanks through obedience to Me and that I have preferred you your forefathers above all the worlds of their time;
The Cow,2,48,"And guard yourselves against a day when no soul will in aught avail another, nor will intercession be accepted from it, nor will compensation be received from it, nor will they be helped.",and fear be scared of the day when no soul for another shall give satisfaction which is the Day of Resurrection and no intercession shall be accepted read either tuqbal or yuqbal from it that is it is not the case that it has power to intercede for it then to be accepted from it or rejected as God says So now we have no intercessors Q. 26100; nor any compensation ransom be taken neither shall they be helped to avoid God’s chastisement.
The Cow,2,49,"And (remember) when We did deliver you from Pharaoh’s folk, who were afflicting you with dreadful torment, slaying your sons and sparing your women: that was a tremendous trial from your Lord.",And remember when We delivered you your forefathers the address here and henceforth directed to those living at the time of the our Prophet is about how God blessed their forefathers and is intended to remind them of God’s grace so that they might believe; from the folk of Pharaoh who were visiting you with that is making you taste evil chastisement of the worst kind the sentence here is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the pronoun suffixed in najjaynākum ‘We delivered you’; slaughtering your newly-born sons this is explaining what has just been said; and sparing retaining your women doing so because of the saying of some of their priests that a child born among the Israelites shall bring about the end of your rule Pharaoh; and for you therein chastisement or deliverance was a tremendous trial a test or a grace from your Lord.
The Cow,2,50,"And when We brought you through the sea and rescued you, and drowned the folk of Pharaoh in your sight.",And remember when We divided split in two for you on account of you the sea such that you were able to cross it and escape from your enemy; and We delivered you from drowning and drowned Pharaoh’s folk his people with him while you were beholding the sea crashing down on top of them.
The Cow,2,51,"And when We did appoint for Moses forty nights (of solitude), and then ye chose the calf, when he had gone from you, and were wrong-doers.",And when We appointed for wā‘adnā or wa‘adnā Moses forty nights at the end of which We shall give him the Torah for you to implement then you took to yourselves the calf the one which the Samaritan fashioned for you as a god after him that is after he departed for Our appointment and you were evildoers for taking it in worship because you directed your worship to the wrong place.
The Cow,2,52,"Then, even after that, We pardoned you in order that ye might give thanks.",Then We pardoned you erasing your sins after that act of worship so that you might be thankful for Our favour upon you.
The Cow,2,53,"And when We gave unto Moses the Scripture and the criterion (of right and wrong), that ye might be led aright.",And when We gave to Moses the Scripture the Torah and the Criterion wa’l-furqān is an explicative supplement of Torah that is the one that discriminates faraqa between truth and falsehood and between what is licit and illicit so that you might be guided by it away from error.
The Cow,2,54,"And when Moses said unto his people: O my people! Ye have wronged yourselves by your choosing of the calf (for worship) so turn in penitence to your Creator, and kill (the guilty) yourselves. That will be best for you with your Creator and He will relent toward you. Lo! He is the Relenting, the Merciful.",And when Moses said to his people those who worshipped the calf ‘My people you have done wrong against yourselves by your taking the golden calf for a god; now turn to your Creator away from that worship of the calf and slay one another that is let the innocent of you slay the guilty; That slaughter will be better for you in your Creator’s sight’ who made it easier for you to accomplish this and sent down a dark cloud over you so that none of you was able to see the other and show him mercy such that almost seventy thousand of you were killed; and He will turn to you relenting before your turning in repentance; truly He is the Relenting the Merciful.
The Cow,2,55,And when ye said: O Moses! We will not believe in thee till we see Allah plainly; and even while ye gazed the lightning seized you.,And when you said having gone out with Moses to apologise before God for your worship of the calf and having heard what he had said to you; ‘O Moses we will not believe you till we see God openly’ with our own eyes; and the thunderbolt the shout took you and you died while you were beholding what was happening to you.
The Cow,2,56,"Then We revived you after your extinction, that ye might give thanks.",Then We raised you up brought you back to life after you were dead so that you might be thankful for this favour of Ours.
The Cow,2,57,"And We caused the white cloud to overshadow you and sent down on you the manna and the quails, (saying): Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you - they wronged Us not, but they did wrong themselves.",And We made the cloud overshadow you that is We sheltered you with fine clouds from the heat of the sun while you were in the wilderness; and We sent down in them the clouds upon you manna and quails — which are respectively a type of citrus known as turunjabīn and the quail — and We said ‘Eat of the good things We have provided for you’ and do not store any of it away but they were not grateful for this favour and stored the food and so they were deprived of it; And they did not wrong Us in this but themselves they wronged since the evil consequences of this befell them.
The Cow,2,58,"And when We said: Go into this township and eat freely of that which is therein, and enter the gate prostrate, and say: ""Repentance."" We will forgive you your sins and will increase (reward) for the right-doers.",And when We said to them after they came out of the wilderness ‘Enter this city either the Holy House of Jerusalem Bayt al-Maqdis or Jericho Arīhā and eat freely therein wherever you will plentifully and without any restrictions and enter it at the gate its gate prostrating bowing and say ‘our request is for an exoneration’ that is ‘That we be exonerated from our transgressions’ and We shall forgive naghfir a variant reading has one of the two passive forms yughfar or tughfar ‘they will be forgiven’ you your transgressions and We shall give more to those who are virtuous’ — through obedience — in terms of reward.
The Cow,2,59,"But those who did wrong changed the word which had been told them for another saying, and We sent down upon the evil-doers wrath from heaven for their evil-doing.",Then the evildoers among them substituted a saying other than that which had been said to them and said instead ‘A grain inside a hair’ and entered the town dragging themselves on their rears; so We sent down upon the evildoers the replacement of the second person of the previous verse with the overt identification in the third person alladhīna zalamū ‘the evildoers’ is intended to emphasise the depravity of their action wrath a punishment of plague from the heaven for their wickedness for deviating from obedience and within a very short period of time just under seventy thousand of them were dead.
The Cow,2,60,"And when Moses asked for water for his people, We said: Smite with thy staff the rock. And there gushed out therefrom twelve springs (so that) each tribe knew their drinking-place. Eat and drink of that which Allah hath provided, and do not act corruptly, making mischief in the earth.",And mention when Moses sought water for his people for they suffered thirst in the wilderness We said ‘Strike with your staff the rock the one that ran off with his robe a light cube-like rock about the size of a man’s head made of marble and he struck it and there exploded there burst and gushed forth from it twelve fountains equal to the number of tribes each people each tribe among them came to know their drinking-place which they did not share with any of the others. And We said to them ‘Eat and drink of that which God has provided and do not be degenerate in the earth seeking corruption’ mufsidīn is a circumstantial qualifier emphasising its operator the subject of the verb lā ta‘thaw ‘do not be degenerate’ derived from ‘athiya meaning afsada ‘to corrupt’.
The Cow,2,61,"And when ye said: O Moses! We are weary of one kind of food; so call upon thy Lord for us that He bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth - of its herbs and its cucumbers and its corn and its lentils and its onions. He said: Would ye exchange that which is higher for that which is lower ? Go down to settled country, thus ye shall get that which ye demand. And humiliation and wretchedness were stamped upon them and they were visited with wrath from Allah. That was because they disbelieved in Allah’s revelations and slew the prophets wrongfully. That was for their disobedience and transgression.",And when you said ‘Moses we will not endure one sort of food that is to say manna and quails; pray to your Lord for us that He may bring forth for us something of min here is explicative what the earth produces — green herbs cucumbers garlic lentils onions’ he Moses said to them ‘Would you exchange what is better more noble that is do you substitute this with what is lowlier?’ the hamza of a-tastabdilūna is for rebuke; they thus refused to change their mind and he Moses supplicated to God and He exalted be He said ‘Go down to a city whichever city it may be; you shall have there what you demanded’ of vegetable produce; And abasement submissiveness and wretchedness that is the signs of poverty on account of their submissiveness and debasement that always accompany them even if they be rich in the same way that a coin never changes its mint; were cast upon them and they incurred ended up with God’s wrath; that that is that affliction and wrath was because they used to disbelieve the signs of God and slay prophets such as Zachariah and John without right that is unjustly; that was because they disobeyed and they were transgressors overstepping the bounds in disobedience here the repetition dhālik bi-mā ‘asaw wa-kānū ya‘tadūn is for emphasis.
The Cow,2,62,"Lo! Those who believe (in that which is revealed unto thee, Muhammad), and those who are Jews, and Christians, and Sabaeans - whoever believeth in Allah and the Last Day and doeth right - surely their reward is with their Lord, and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve.",Surely those who believe who believed before in the prophets and those of Jewry the Jews and the Christians and the Sabaeans a Christian or Jewish sect whoever from among them believes in God and the Last Day in the time of our Prophet and performs righteous deeds according to the Law given to him — their wage that is the reward for their deeds is with their Lord and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve the singular person of the verbs āmana ‘believes’ and ‘amila ‘performs’ takes account of the singular form of man ‘whoever’ but in what comes afterwards of the plural pronouns its plural meaning is taken into account.
The Cow,2,63,"And (remember, O Children of Israel) when We made a covenant with you and caused the mount to tower above you, (saying): Hold fast that which We have given you, and remember that which is therein, that ye may ward off (evil).",And mention when We made a covenant with you your pledge to act according to what is in the Torah and We had raised above you the Mount which We uprooted from the earth and placed above you when you refused to accept it sc. the Torah and We said ‘Take forcefully seriously and with effort what We have given you and remember what is in it acting in accordance with it so that you might preserve yourselves’ from the Fire or acts of disobedience.
The Cow,2,64,"Then, even after that, ye turned away, and if it had not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy ye had been among the losers. .",Then you turned away thereafter and but for God’s bounty and His mercy towards you you would have been among the losers there is no commentary on this verse.
The Cow,2,65,"And ye know of those of you who broke the Sabbath, how We said unto them: Be ye apes, despised and hated!",And verily wa-la-qad the lām is for oaths you know that there were those among you who transgressed violated the Sabbath by fishing when We had forbidden you to do so — these were the inhabitants of Eilat — and We said to them ‘Be apes despised!’ rejected and they became so they died three days later.
The Cow,2,66,"And We made it an example to their own and to succeeding generations, and an admonition to the God-fearing.",And We made it this punishment an exemplary punishment a lesson to dissuade others from doing what they did; for all the former times and for the latter that is for the people of that time or those that came later; and an admonition to such as who fear God these are singled out for mention here because they in contrast to others are the ones who benefit thereby.
The Cow,2,67,"And when Moses said unto his people: Lo! Allah commandeth you that ye sacrifice a cow, they said: Dost thou make game of us ? He answered: Allah forbid that I should be among the foolish!",And mention when Moses said to his people when one among them was killed and the killer was not known and so they asked Moses to pray to God to reveal the killer which he did; ‘God commands you to sacrifice a cow’. They said ‘Do you take us in mockery?’ that is making fun of us when you answer us like this? He said ‘I take refuge with I seek defence with God lest I should be one of the ignorant’ one of those who indulge in mockery.
The Cow,2,68,"They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what (cow) she is. (Moses) answered: Lo! He saith, Verily she is a cow neither with calf nor immature; (she is) between the two conditions; so do that which ye are commanded.",But when they realised that he was being serious They said ‘Pray to your Lord for us that He may make clear to us what she may be’ its true nature He Moses said ‘He God says she is a cow neither old nor virgin that is young middling between the two in terms of age; so do what you have been commanded’ by way of sacrificing it.
The Cow,2,69,"They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us of what colour she is. (Moses) answered: Lo! He saith: Verily she is a yellow cow. Bright is her colour, gladdening beholders.",They said ‘Pray to your Lord for us that He make clear to us what her colour may be’ He said ‘He says she shall be a golden cow bright in colour that is of a very intense yellow gladdening to beholders its beauty will please those that look at it.
The Cow,2,70,"They said: Pray for us unto thy Lord that He make clear to us what (cow) she is. Lo! cows are much alike to us; and Lo! if Allah wills, we may be led aright.",They said ‘Pray to your Lord for us that He make clear to us what she may be does it graze freely or is it used in labour?; the cows that is the species described in the way mentioned are all alike to us because there are many of them and we have not been able to find the one sought after; and if God wills we shall then be guided’ to it. In one hadīth it is reported ‘Had they not uttered the proviso inshā’a Llāh it would never have been made clear to them’.
The Cow,2,71,"(Moses) answered: Lo! He saith: Verily she is a cow unyoked; she plougheth not the soil nor watereth the tilth; whole and without mark. They said: Now thou bringest the truth. So they sacrificed her, though almost they did not.",He said ‘He says she shall be a cow not broken not subdued for labour that is to plough the earth churning its soil for sowing tuthīr al-ard the clause describes the word dhalūl and constitutes part of the negation; or to water the tillage that is the land prepared for sowing; one safe from faults and the effects of toil; with no blemish of a colour other than her own on her’. They said ‘Now you have brought the truth’ that is now you have explained it clearly; they thus sought it out and found it with a boy very dutiful towards his mother and they eventually purchased it for the equivalent of its weight in gold; and so they sacrificed her even though they very nearly did not on account of its excessive cost. In a hadīth it is stated that ‘Had they sacrificed any cow it would have sufficed them but they made it difficult for themselves and so God made it difficult for them’.
The Cow,2,72,And (remember) when ye slew a man and disagreed concerning it and Allah brought forth that which ye were hiding.,And when you killed a living soul and disputed thereon iddāra’tum the tā’ of the root-form itdāra’tum has been assimilated with the dāl — and God disclosed what you were hiding this is a parenthetical statement; the story begins here with wa-idh qataltum nafsan ‘and when you killed a soul’… and continues in the following
The Cow,2,73,And We said: Smite him with some of it. Thus Allah bringeth the dead to life and showeth you His portents so that ye may understand.,so We said ‘Smite him the slain man with part of it’ and so when he was struck with its tongue or its tail he came back to life and said ‘So-and-so killed me’ and after pointing out two of his cousins he died; the two killers were denied the inheritance and were later killed. God says even so is the revival for God brings to life the dead and He shows you His signs the proofs of His power so that you might understand that you might reflect and realise that the One capable of reviving a single soul is also capable of reviving a multitude of souls and then believe.
The Cow,2,74,"Then, even after that, your hearts were hardened and became as rocks, or worse than rocks, for hardness. For indeed there are rocks from out which rivers gush, and indeed there are rocks which split asunder so that water floweth from them. And indeed there are rocks which fall down for the fear of Allah. Allah is not unaware of what ye do.",Then your hearts became hardened O you Jews they your hearts became stiffened against acceptance of the truth thereafter that is after what is mentioned of the bringing back to life of the slain man and the other signs before this; and they are like stones in their hardness or even yet harder than these; for there are stones from which rivers come gushing and others split yashshaqqaq the initial tā’ of the root-form yatashaqqaq has been assimilated with the shīn so that water issues from them; and others come down from on high in fear of God while your hearts are unmoved unstirred and not humbled; And God is not heedless of what you do but instead He gives you respite until your time comes ta‘malūna ‘you do’ a variant reading has ya‘malūna ‘they do’ indicating a shift to the third person address.
The Cow,2,75,"Have ye any hope that they will be true to you when a party of them used to listen to the word of Allah, then used to change it, after they had understood it, knowingly ?",Are you then so eager O believers that they the Jews should believe you seeing there is a party of them a group of their rabbis that heard God’s word in the Torah and then tampered with it changing it and that after they had comprehended it after they had understood it knowingly? knowing full well that they were indulging in mendacity the hamza at the beginning of the verb a-fa-tatma‘ūn is an interrogative for rejection in other words ‘Do not be so eager for they have disbelieved before’.
The Cow,2,76,"And when they fall in with those who believe, they say: We believe. But when they go apart one with another they say: Prate ye to them of that which Allah hath disclosed to you that they may contend with you before your Lord concerning it ? Have ye then no sense ?",And when they the hypocrites from among the Jews meet those who believe they say ‘We believe’ that Muhammad (s) is a prophet and that he is the one of whom we have been given good tidings in our Book; but when they go in private one to another they their leaders the ones not involved in the hypocrisy say to those hypocrites ‘Do you speak to them the believers of what God has disclosed to you that is what He has made known to you of Muhammad’s s description in the Torah so that they may thereby dispute the lām of li-yuhājjūkum ‘that they may dispute with you’ is the lām of ‘becoming’ with you before your Lord? in the Hereafter and hold the proof against you for not following him Muhammad (s) despite your knowledge of his sincerity? Have you no understanding?’ of the fact that they will contend with you if you speak to them in this way? So beware.
The Cow,2,77,Are they then unaware that Allah knoweth that which they keep hidden and that which they proclaim ?,God says Know they not the interrogative is affirmative the inserted wāw of a-wa-lā is to indicate the supplement that God knows what they keep secret and what they proclaim? that is what they hide and what they reveal in this matter and all other matters so that they may desist from these things.
The Cow,2,78,Among them are unlettered folk who know the Scripture not except from hearsay. They but guess.,And there are some of them the Jews that are illiterate unlettered not knowing the Scripture the Torah but only desires lies which were handed down to them by their leaders and which they relied upon; and in their rejection of the prophethood of the Prophet and fabrications of other matters they have mere conjectures and no firm knowledge.
The Cow,2,79,"Therefore woe be unto those who write the Scripture with their hands and then say, ""This is from Allah,"" that they may purchase a small gain therewith. Woe unto them for that their hands have written, and woe unto them for that they earn thereby.",So woe a severe chastisement to those who write the Scripture with their hands that is fabricating it themselves then say ‘This is from God’ that they may sell it for a small price of this world these are the Jews the ones that altered the description of the Prophet in the Torah as well as the ‘stoning’ verse and other details and rewrote them in a way different from that in which they were revealed. So woe to them for what their hands have written of fabrications and woe to them for their earnings by way of bribery rishan plural of rishwa.
The Cow,2,80,And they say: The Fire (of punishment) will not touch us save for a certain number of days. Say: Have ye received a covenant from Allah - truly Allah will not break His covenant - or tell ye concerning Allah that which ye know not ?,And they say when the Prophet promised them the Fire ‘the Fire shall not touch us that is afflict us save a number of days’ only a short time of forty days the same length of time their forefathers worshipped the calf after which time it the Fire will cease. Say to them Muhammad (s) ‘Have you taken with God a covenant? a pledge from Him to this? God will not fail in His covenant in this matter or — nay — say you against God what you do not know? a’ttakhadhtum the conjunctive hamza has been omitted on account of the interrogative hamza sufficing.
The Cow,2,81,"Nay, but whosoever hath done evil and his sin surroundeth him; such are rightful owners of the Fire; they will abide therein.",Not so it will touch you and you will abide therein; whoever earns evil through associating another with God and is encompassed by his transgression in the singular and the plural that is to say it overcomes him and encircles him totally for he has died an idolater — those are the inhabitants of the Fire therein abiding khālidūn this plural noun takes account of the plural import of man ‘whoever’.
The Cow,2,82,And those who believe and do good works: such are rightful owners of the Garden. They will abide therein.,And those who believe and perform righteous deeds — those are the inhabitants of Paradise therein abiding.
The Cow,2,83,"And (remember) when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel, (saying): Worship none save Allah (only), and be good to parents and to kindred and to orphans and the needy, and speak kindly to mankind; and establish worship and pay the poor-due. Then, after that, ye slid back, save a few of you, being averse.",And mention when We made a covenant with the Children of Israel in the Torah where We said ‘You shall not worship a variant reading for lā ta‘budūna has third person plural lā ya‘budūn ‘they shall not worship’ any other than God lā ta‘budūna illā Llāha is a predicate denoting a prohibition; one may also read lā ta‘budū Worship you not; and to be good and righteous to parents and the near of kin here kinship is adjoined to parents; and to orphans and to the needy; and speak well good words to men commanding good and forbidding evil being truthful with regard to the status of Muhammad (s) and being kind to them sc. orphans and the needy a variant reading for hasanan has husnan the verbal noun used as a hyperbolic description; and observe prayer and pay the alms’ which you actually accepted but then you turned away refusing to fulfil these obligations here the second person address is used but their forefathers are still meant; all but a few of you rejecting it like your forefathers.
The Cow,2,84,And when We made with you a covenant (saying): Shed not the blood of your people nor turn (a party of) your people out of your dwellings. Then ye ratified (Our covenant) and ye were witnesses (thereto).,And when We made a covenant with you and We said ‘You shall not shed your own blood spilling it by slaying one another; neither expel your own from your habitations’ let no one of you expel the other from his house; then you confirmed it that is you accepted this covenant and you bore witness upon your own souls.
The Cow,2,85,"Yet ye it is who slay each other and drive out a party of your people from their homes, supporting one another against them by sin and transgression ? - and if they came to you as captives ye would ransom them, whereas their expulsion was itself unlawful for you - Believe ye in part of the Scripture and disbelieve ye in part thereof ? And what is the reward of those who do so save ignominy in the life of the world, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be consigned to the most grievous doom. For Allah is not unaware of what ye do.",Then there you are killing one another and expelling a party of you from their habitations conspiring tazzāharūna the original ta’ has been assimilated with the zā’; a variant reading has it without the assimilation that is tazāharūna assisting one another against them in sin in disobedience and enmity injustice and if they come to you as captives a variant reading for usārā has asrā you ransom them a variant reading for tafdūhum has tufādūhum that is to say you deliver them from captivity with money etc. and this ransoming was one of the things to which they were pledged; yet their expulsion was forbidden you muharramun ‘alaykum ikhrājuhum is semantically connected to wa-tukhrijūna ‘and expelling’ and the statement that comes in between is parenthetical that is expulsion was forbidden you in the same way that non-ransoming was forbidden you. Qurayza had allied themselves with the Aws and the Nadīr with the Khazraj but every member of an alliance would fight against a fellow ally thus destroying each other’s homes and expelling one another taking prisoners and then ransoming them. When they were asked ‘Why do you fight them and then pay their ransom?’ they would reply ‘Because we have been commanded to ransom’; and they would be asked ‘So why do you fight them then?’ to which they would say ‘For fear that our allies be humiliated’; God exalted says What do you believe in part of the Book that is the part about ransom and disbelieve in part? namely the part about renouncing fighting expulsion and assistance against one another; What shall be the requital of those of you who do that but degradation disgrace and ignominy in the life of this world they were disgraced when Qurayza were slewn and the Nadīr were expelled to Syria and ordered to pay the jizya; and on the Day of Resurrection to be returned to the most terrible of chastisement? And God is not heedless of what you do ta‘malūna or read ya‘malūna ‘they do’.
The Cow,2,86,"Such are those who buy the life of the world at the price of the Hereafter. Their punishment will not be lightened, neither will they have support.",Those are the ones who have purchased the life of this world at the price of the Hereafter by preferring the former to the latter — for them the punishment shall not be lightened neither shall they be helped neither shall they be protected against it.
The Cow,2,87,"And verily We gave unto Moses the Scripture and We caused a train of messengers to follow after him, and We gave unto Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs (of Allah’s sovereignty), and We supported him with the Holy spirit. Is it ever so, that, when there cometh unto you a messenger (from Allah) with that which ye yourselves desire not, ye grow arrogant, and some ye disbelieve and some ye slay ?",And We gave Moses the Scripture the Torah and after him We sent successive messengers that is We sent them one after another and We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs that is the miracles of bringing the dead back to life and healing the blind and the leper and We confirmed him We strengthened him with the Holy Spirit the expression rūh al-qudus is an example of annexing in a genitive construction the noun described to the adjective qualifying it in other words al-rūh al-muqaddasa that is Gabriel so described on account of his Jesus’s sanctity; he would accompany him Jesus wherever he went; still you refuse to be upright and whenever there came to you a messenger with what your souls did not desire did not like in the way of truth you became arrogant you disdained to follow him istakbartum ‘you became arrogant’ is the response to the particle kullamā ‘whenever’ and constitutes the interrogative and is meant as a rebuke; and some of them you called liars such as Jesus and some you slay? such as Zachariah and John the present tenses of these verbs are used to narrate the past events as though they were events in the present in other words ‘and some you slew’.
The Cow,2,88,"And they say: Our hearts are hardened. Nay, but Allah hath cursed them for their unbelief. Little is that which they believe.",And they say to the Prophet mockingly ‘Our hearts are encased’ ghulf is the plural of aghlaf that is to say wrapped up in covers and cannot comprehend what you say; God exalted be He says Nay bal introduces the rebuttal but God has cursed them removed them far from His mercy and degraded them when they rejected the messengers for their unbelief which is not the result of anything defective in their hearts; and little will they believe fa-qalīlan mā yu’minūn the mā here is extra emphasising the ‘littleness’ involved that is their belief is minimal.
The Cow,2,89,"And when there cometh unto them a scripture from Allah, confirming that in their possession - though before that they were asking for a signal triumph over those who disbelieved - and when there cometh unto them that which they know (to be the truth) they disbelieve therein. The curse of Allah is on disbelievers.",When there came to them a Book from God confirming what was with them in the Torah that is the Qur’ān — and they formerly before it came prayed for victory for assistance over the disbelievers saying ‘God give us assistance against them through the Prophet that shall be sent at the end of time’; but when there came to them what they recognised as the truth that is the mission of the Prophet they disbelieved in it out of envy and for fear of losing leadership the response to the first lammā particle is indicated by the response to the second one; and the curse of God is on the disbelievers.
The Cow,2,90,"Evil is that for which they sell their souls: that they should disbelieve in that which Allah hath revealed, grudging that Allah should reveal of His bounty unto whom He will of His slaves. They have incurred anger upon anger. For disbelievers is a shameful doom.",Evil is that for which they sell their souls that is their share of the reward in the Hereafter bi’samā ‘evil is that for which’ mā here is an indefinite particle representing ‘a thing’ and constitutes a specification qualifying the subject of the verb bi’s ‘evil is’ the very thing being singled out for criticism; that they disbelieve in that Qur’ān which God has revealed grudging baghyan here is an object denoting reason for yakfurū ‘they disbelieve’ that is out of envy that God should reveal read either yunzil or yunazzil of His bounty the Inspiration to whomever He will of His servants to deliver the Message; and they were laden they returned with anger from God for their disbelief in what He has revealed the indefinite form bi-ghadabin ‘with anger’ is used to emphasise the awesomeness of the ‘anger’ upon anger which they deserved formerly when they neglected the Torah and disbelieved in Jesus; and for the disbelievers there shall be a humiliating chastisement.
The Cow,2,91,"And when it is said unto them: Believe in that which Allah hath revealed, they say: We believe in that which was revealed unto us. And they disbelieve in that which cometh after it, though it is the truth confirming that which they possess. Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Why then slew ye the prophets of Allah aforetime, if ye are (indeed) believers ?",And when it was said to them ‘Believe in what God has revealed that is the Qur’ān and other Books they said ‘We believe in what was revealed to us’ that is the Torah; and wā here indicates a circumstantial qualifier they disbelieve in what is beyond that what is other than that or what came afterwards such as the Qur’ān; yet it is the truth wa-huwa’l-haqqu is a circumstantial qualifier confirming musaddiqan a second circumstantial qualifier for emphasis what is with them. Say to them ‘Why then were you slaying the prophets of God formerly if you were believers?’ in the Torah and in it you were forbidden to kill them this address concerning what their forefathers did is directed towards those present at the time of our Prophet on account of their approval of it that is of what the forefathers had done.
The Cow,2,92,"And Moses came unto you with clear proofs (of Allah’s Sovereignty), yet, while he was away, ye chose the calf (for worship) and ye were wrong-doers.",And Moses came to you with clear proofs miracles such as the staff his hand and the parting of the sea; then you took to yourselves the calf as a god after him after he had gone to the appointment and you were evildoers for taking it in worship.
The Cow,2,93,"And when We made with you a covenant and caused the Mount to tower above you, (saying): Hold fast by that which We have given you, and hear (Our Word), they said: We hear and we rebel. And (worship of) the calf was made to sink into their hearts because of their rejection (of the covenant). Say (unto them): Evil is that which your belief enjoineth on you, if ye are believers.",And when We made a covenant with you to act according to what is in the Torah and raised over you the Mount to drop it on you when you had refused to accept it; We said ‘Take forcefully seriously and with effort what We have given you and listen’ to what you have been commanded and be prepared to accept it They said ‘We hear your words and disobey’ your command; and they were made to drink the calf in their hearts that is to say the love of it the golden calf intoxicated their hearts in the way that wine does on account of their unbelief. Say to them ‘Evil is that thing which your belief in the Torah enjoins on you in the way of the worship of the golden calf if you are believers’ in it as you claim; meaning you are not believers for faith does not command that you worship the calf — their forefathers are meant here. Likewise you do not believe in the Torah because you have denied the prophethood of Muhammad (s) whereas faith in it does not command you to reject him.
The Cow,2,94,"Say (unto them): If the abode of the Hereafter in the providence of Allah is indeed for you alone and not for others of mankind (as ye pretend), then long for death (for ye must long for death) if ye are truthful.",Say to them ‘If the Abode of the Hereafter that is Paradise with God is purely yours that is exclusively and not for other people as you allege then long for death — if you speak truly’ here both conditionals are connected to the verb tamannū ‘long for’ so that the first is dependent upon the second in other words ‘If you speak truly when you claim that it is yours then you will naturally incline to what is yours and since the path to it is death long for it death’.
The Cow,2,95,"But they will never long for it, because of that which their own hands have sent before them. Allah is aware of evil-doers.",But they will never long for it because of that which their own hands have sent before them as a result of their rejection of the Prophet s the consequence of their mendacity. God knows the evildoers the disbelievers and He will requite them.
The Cow,2,96,And thou wilt find them greediest of mankind for life and (greedier) than the idolaters. (Each) one of them would like to be allowed to live a thousand years. And to live (a thousand years) would be no means remove him from the doom. Allah is Seer of what they do.,And you shall find them the lām of la-tajidannahum is for oaths the people most covetous of life and more covetous of it than the idolaters who reject the idea of the Resurrection for the former know that their journey’s end will be the Fire while the idolaters do not believe even in this; any one of them would love wishes that he might be given life for a thousand years law yu‘ammar ‘if only he might be given life’ the particle law ‘if only’ relates to the verbal noun and functions with the sense of an ‘that’ and together with its relative clause explains the implicit verbal noun in the object of the verb yawaddu ‘he would love’; yet any one of them his being given life an yu‘ammara ‘that he should be given life’ constitutes the subject of the verb muzahzihihi ‘that it should budge him’ this verb comes later as though it were ta‘mīruhu ‘the giving of life to him’ shall not budge remove him from the chastisement of the Fire. God sees what they do ya‘malūna may be alternatively read ta‘malūna ‘you do’ and will requite them. ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Sūryā asked the Prophet s or ‘Umar b. al-Khattāb about which angel brings down the revelation and he replied that it was Gabriel; he Ibn Sūryā then said ‘He is our enemy because he brings chastisement with him; had it been Michael we would have believed in him because he brings fertility and security.’ Then the following was revealed
The Cow,2,97,"Say (O Muhammad, to mankind): Who is an enemy to Gabriel! For he it is who hath revealed (this Scripture) to thy heart by Allah’s leave, confirming that which was (revealed) before it, and a guidance and glad tidings to believers;",Say to them ‘Whoever is an enemy to Gabriel let him die in exasperation — he it was that brought it the Qur’ān down upon your heart by the leave by the command of God confirming what was before it of scriptures a guidance from error and good tidings of Paradise for the believers.
The Cow,2,98,"Who is an enemy to Allah, and His angels and His messengers, and Gabriel and Michael! Then, lo! Allah (Himself) is an enemy to the disbelievers.",Whoever is an enemy to God and His angels and His messengers and Gabriel read Jibrīl or Jabrīl Jibra’il or Jabra’il Jibra’īl or Jabra’īl and Michael Mīkāl also read Mīkā’īl or Mīkā’il; a supplement to malā’ikatihi ‘His angels’ an example of the specific being supplemented to the collective — then surely God is an enemy to the disbelievers’ He says ‘to the disbelievers’ instead of ‘to them’ in order to point out their status.
The Cow,2,99,"Verily We have revealed unto thee clear tokens, and only miscreants will disbelieve in them.",And We have revealed to you O Muhammad (s) clear proofs lucid ones bayyinātin ‘clear proofs’ is a circumstantial qualifier; this was in response to Ibn Sūryā saying to the Prophet s ‘You have not brought us anything’; and none disbelieves in them except the wicked these have disbelieved in them.
The Cow,2,100,"Is it ever so that when they make a covenant a party of them set it aside ? The truth is, most of them believe not.",Why whenever they make a covenant with God that they will believe in the Prophet s when he appears or that they will not give assistance to the idolaters against the Prophet s does a party of them reject it? cast it away repudiating it this is the response to the clause beginning with kullamā the interrogative of rebuke. Nay bal indicates a transition but most of them are disbelievers.
The Cow,2,101,"And when there cometh unto them a messenger from Allah, confirming that which they possess, a party of those who have received the Scripture fling the Scripture of Allah behind their backs as if they knew not,",When there came to them a messenger from God namely Muhammad (s) confirming what was with them a party of them who were given the Scripture have cast away the Scripture of God that is the Torah behind their backs that is to say they have not acted according to what it said about belief in the Messenger and otherwise; as though they did not know what is contained in it to the effect that he is a true Prophet or that it is the Book of God.
The Cow,2,102,"And follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of Solomon. Solomon disbelieved not; but the devils disbelieved, teaching mankind magic and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babel, Harut and Marut. Nor did they (the two angels) teach it to anyone till they had said: We are only a temptation, therefore disbelieve not (in the guidance of Allah). And from these two (angles) people learn that by which they cause division between man and wife; but they injure thereby no- one save by Allah’s leave. And they learn that which harmeth them and profiteth them not. And surely they do know that he who trafficketh therein will have no (happy) portion in the Hereafter; and surely evil is the price for which they sell their souls, if they but knew.",And they follow wa’ttaba‘ū is a supplement to nabadha ‘it cast away’ what the devils used to relate during the time of Solomon’s kingdom in the way of sorcery it is said that they the devils buried these books of sorcery underneath his throne when his kingdom was taken from him; it is also said that they used to listen stealthily and add fabrications to what they heard and then pass it on to the priests who would compile it in books; this would be disseminated and rumours spread that the jinn had knowledge of the Unseen. Solomon gathered these books and buried them. When he died the devils showed people where these books were and the latter brought them out and found that they contained sorcery and said ‘Your kingdom was only thanks to what is in here’; they then took to learning them and rejected the Scriptures of their prophets. In order to demonstrate Solomon’s innocence and in repudiation of the Jews when they said ‘Look at this Muhammad he mentions Solomon as one of the prophets when he was only a sorcerer’ God exalted says Solomon disbelieved not that is he did not work magic because he disbelieved but the devils disbelieved teaching the people sorcery this sentence is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person governing the verb kafarū; and teaching them that which was revealed to the two angels that is the sorcery that they were inspired to perform al-malakayn ‘the two angels’ a variant reading has al-malikayn ‘the two kings’ who were in Babylon — a town in lower Iraq — Hārūt and Mārūt here the names are standing in for ‘the two angels’ or an explication of the latter. Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘They were two sorcerers who used to teach people magic’; it is also said that they were two angels that had been sent to teach sorcery to people as a trial from God. They taught not any man without them saying by way of counsel ‘We are but a temptation a trial from God for people so that He may test them when they are taught it whoever learns it is a disbeliever but whoever renounces it he is a believer; do not disbelieve’ by learning it; if this person refused and insisted on learning it they would teach him.
The Cow,2,103,"And if they had believed and kept from evil, a recompense from Allah would be better, if they only knew.",Yet if only they the Jews had believed in the Prophet and the Qur’ān and been fearful of God’s chastisement by abandoning acts of disobedience towards Him such as sorcery the response to the conditional clause beginning with law ‘if’ has been omitted but it is intimated to be ‘they would have been rewarded’ and this is indicated by His following words verily a reward from God would have been better than that for which they sold themselves if they had but known that this is better they would not have preferred that over this la-mathūbatun ‘verily the reward’ is the subject; the lām is that of oaths; and min ‘indi’Llāhi khayrun ‘from God would have been better’ is the predicate.
The Cow,2,104,"O ye who believe, say not (unto the Prophet): ""Listen to us"" but say ""Look upon us,"" and be ye listeners. For disbelievers is a painful doom.",O you who believe do not say to the Prophet s ‘Observe us’ rā‘inā is an imperative form from murā‘āt which they used to say to him and this was a derogatory term in Hebrew derived from the noun al-ru‘ūna ‘thoughtlessness’. They found this very amusing and used to address the Prophet s in this way and so the believers were forbidden to use it; but say instead ‘Regard us’ that is look at us and give ear to what you are commanded and be prepared to accept it; and for disbelievers awaits a painful chastisement that is the Fire.
The Cow,2,105,"Neither those who disbelieve among the people of the Scripture nor the idolaters love that there should be sent down unto you any good thing from your Lord. But Allah chooseth for His mercy whom He will, and Allah is of Infinite Bounty.",Those disbelievers of the People of the Scripture and the idolaters from among the Arabs al-mushrikīna ‘idolaters’ is a supplement to ahl al-kitābi ‘People of the Scripture’ and the min ‘of’ is explicative do not wish that any good any Inspiration should be revealed to you from your Lord out of envy of you but God singles out for His mercy for the office of His Prophet whom He will; God is of bounty abounding.
The Cow,2,106,"Nothing of our revelation (even a single verse) do we abrogate or cause be forgotten, but we bring (in place) one better or the like thereof. Knowest thou not that Allah is Able to do all things ?",When the disbelievers began to deride the matter of abrogation saying that one day Muhammad enjoins his Companions to one thing and then the next day he forbids it God revealed And whatever verse mā is the conditional particle that has been revealed containing a judgement We abrogate either together with its recital or not that is only its judgement but its recital continues; there is a variant reading nunsikh meaning ‘Whatever verse We command you or Gabriel to abrogate’ or postpone so that We do not reveal the judgement contained in it and We withhold its recital or retain it in the Preserved Tablet; a variant reading of nunsi’hā is nunsihā from ‘to forget’ so ‘Whatever verse We abrogate or We make you forget that is We erase from your heart’; the response to the conditional sentence begun with mā is We bring in place a better one that is more beneficial for Our servants either because it is easier to implement or contains much reward; or the like of it in terms of religious obligation and reward; do you not know that God has power over all things? including abrogating and substituting verses? the interrogative here is meant as an affirmative.
The Cow,2,107,"Knowest thou not that it is Allah unto Whom belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth; and ye have not, beside Allah, any guardian or helper ?",Do you not know that to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth doing what He pleases and that you have none besides God other than God neither protector to safeguard you nor helper? to keep away His chastisement when it comes.
The Cow,2,108,"Or would ye question your messenger as Moses was questioned aforetime ? He who chooseth disbelief instead of faith, verily he hath gone astray from a plain road.",When the Meccans asked the Prophet to enlarge the size of Mecca and make Safā full of gold the following was revealed Or do you desire to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned by his people aforetime? when they asked him to show them God openly among other things; whoever exchanges belief for unbelief taking the latter in place of the former by refraining from contemplating the clear proofs and by requesting others instead has surely strayed from the even way meaning he has mistaken the proper path al-sawā‘ essentially means al-wasat ‘middle way’.
The Cow,2,109,"Many of the people of the Scripture long to make you disbelievers after your belief, through envy on their own account, after the truth hath become manifest unto them. Forgive and be indulgent (toward them) until Allah give command. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.",Many of the People of the Scripture long that law ‘if only that’ represents the import of the verbal noun they might make you disbelievers after you have believed from the envy hasadan is the object denoting reason being of their own souls that is to say their wicked souls have prompted them to this attitude; after the truth with regard to the Prophet s has become clear to them in the Torah; yet pardon leave them be and be forgiving stay away and make no encroachments against them till God brings His command concerning fighting them; truly God has power over all things.
The Cow,2,110,"Establish worship, and pay the poor-due; and whatever of good ye send before (you) for your souls, ye will find it with Allah. Lo! Allah is Seer of what ye do.",And perform the prayer and pay the alms; whatever good in the way of obedience such as observing kinship and charity you shall offer for your own souls you shall find it that is its reward with God; assuredly God sees what you do and will requite you for it.
The Cow,2,111,And they say: None entereth paradise unless he be a Jew or a Christian. These are their own desires. Say: Bring your proof (of what ye state) if ye are truthful.,And they say ‘None shall enter Paradise except those who are Jews hūd is the plural of hā’id or Christians’ this is what the Jews of Medina and the Christians of Najrān said when they disputed with the Prophet s each party separately claiming Paradise for its members exclusively. Such sayings are their desires their false passions. Say to them ‘Produce your proof your evidence for this if you speak truly’ in this matter.
The Cow,2,112,"Nay, but whosoever surrendereth his purpose to Allah while doing good, his reward is with his Lord; and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve.",Nay but others will also enter Paradise namely whoever submits his purpose to God that is adheres to His commands wajh ‘face’ sc. ‘purpose’ is here mentioned because it is the most noble part of the body so that when it has submitted there is all the more reason for the other parts to follow being virtuous affirming God’s Oneness his reward is with his Lord the reward of his deeds being Paradise and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter.
The Cow,2,113,"And the Jews say the Christians follow nothing (true), and the Christians say the Jews follow nothing (true); yet both are readers of the Scripture. Even thus speak those who know not. Allah will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they differ.",The Jews say ‘The Christians stand on nothing’ that can be used as support for their claims and they rejected Jesus; and the Christians say ‘The Jews stand on nothing’ that can be used as support for their claims and they rejected Moses; yet they both groups recite the Scripture revealed to them in the Scripture of the Jews there is the confirmation of Jesus and in that of the Christians there is the confirmation of Moses yatlūna’l-kitāba ‘they recite the Scripture’ the sentence is a circumstantial qualifier. Thus in the way that these have said the ignorant from among the Arabs and others say the like of what these say this last phrase mithla qawlihim ‘the like of what they say’ is the explication of dhālika ‘that way’ that is to say to every person of religion they would say ‘You have no basis’; God shall decide between them on the Day of Resurrection regarding their differences in religion and will admit the confirmer into Paradise and the falsifier into the Fire.
The Cow,2,114,"And who doth greater wrong than he who forbiddeth the approach to the sanctuaries of Allah lest His name should be mentioned therein, and striveth for their ruin. As for such, it was never meant that they should enter them except in fear. Theirs in the world is ignominy and theirs in the Hereafter is an awful doom.",And who does greater evil — that is none does more evil — than he who bars God’s places of worship so that His Name be not invoked in them in prayer and praise and strives to ruin them? through destruction and impeding people from them this was revealed to inform of the Byzantines’ destruction of the Holy House sc. Jerusalem or it was revealed when the idolaters barred the Prophet s from entering Mecca in the year of the battle of Hudaybiyya; such men might never enter them save in fear illā khā’ifīna is a predicate also functioning as a command that is to say ‘Frighten them by threats of waging war against them so that not one of them shall enter it feeling secure’; for them in this world is degradation debasement through being killed taken captive and forced to pay the jizya; and in the Hereafter a mighty chastisement namely the Fire.
The Cow,2,115,"Unto Allah belong the East and the West, and whithersoever ye turn, there is Allah’s Countenance. Lo! Allah is All-Embracing, All- Knowing.",The following was revealed either when the Jews criticised the change of the direction of prayer qibla or concerning the supererogatory prayers on animal-back during journeys which one may pray in any direction To God belong the East and the West that is the entire earth because these two directions represent both sides of it the earth; whithersoever you turn your faces in prayer by His command there is the Face of God the direction of prayer with which He is pleased. Lo! God is Embracing His bounty embracing all things Knowing how to manage His creation.
The Cow,2,116,"And they say: Allah hath taken unto Himself a son. Be He glorified! Nay, but whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth is His. All are subservient unto Him.",And they the Jews and the Christians and those that claim that the angels are God’s daughters say read wa-qālū or simply qālū ‘God has taken to Himself a son’; God says Glory be to Him! as a way of exalting Himself above this; Nay to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth as possessions creatures and servants and this sovereignty contradicts having a child and is expressed by the particle mā ‘all that’ in order to include all creation that is not rational; all obey His will submitting to that which is required from each one of them here the emphasis is on rational beings.
The Cow,2,117,"The Originator of the heavens and the earth! When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is.",Creator of the heavens and the earth making them exist without any exemplary precedent; and when He decrees wills a thing to exist He but says to it ‘Be’ and it is that is to say it becomes fa-yakūnu a variant reading has fa-yakūna on account of it being the response in the subjunctive mood to the jussive statement.
The Cow,2,118,"And those who have no knowledge say: Why doth not Allah speak unto us, or some sign come unto us ? Even thus, as they now speak, spake those (who were) before them. Their hearts are all alike. We have made clear the revelations for people who are sure.",And they that is the disbelievers of Mecca who do not know say to the Prophet s ‘Why does God not speak to us? to say that you are His Messenger; Why does a sign not come to us?’ of the sort we have requested in order to show your sincerity. So in the same way that these disbelievers have spoken spoke those before them from among past communities to their prophets the like of what they say in their obstinacy and demand for signs; their hearts are much alike in terms of unbelief and stubbornness this is meant as consolation for the Prophet s. Yet We have made clear the signs to a people who are certain a people who know that these are God’s signs and so they believe in them for to request other signs would be obduracy.
The Cow,2,119,"Lo! We have sent thee (O Muhammad) with the truth, a bringer of glad tidings and a warner. And thou wilt not be asked about the owners of hell-fire.",We have sent you Muhammad (s) with the truth the guidance a bearer of good tidings of Paradise for those who respond to this guidance and warner of the Fire to those who do not respond to it. You shall not be asked about the inhabitants of Hell-fire that is about why the disbelievers did not believe for your responsibility is only to deliver the Message a variant reading of lā tus’al is lā tas’al ‘do not ask’ with the final apocopation of the vowel on account of it being an imperative.
The Cow,2,120,"And the Jews will not be pleased with thee, nor will the Christians, till thou follow their creed. Say: Lo! the guidance of Allah (Himself) is Guidance. And if thou shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge which hath come unto thee, then wouldst thou have from Allah no protecting guardian nor helper.",Never will the Jews be pleased with you neither the Christians not until you follow their creed their religion Say ‘God’s guidance that is Islam is the true guidance’ besides which there is only error. And if you were wa-la-in the lām is for oaths to follow their whims hypothetically speaking whims to which they are calling you after the knowledge the Divine revelation that has come to you you shall have against God neither friend to protect you nor helper to defend you against Him.
The Cow,2,121,"Those unto whom We have given the Scripture, who read it with the right reading, those believe in it. And whoso disbelieveth in it, those are they who are the losers.",Those to whom We have given the Scripture this is the subject of the sentence and who recite it with true recitation that is who recite it as it was revealed haqqa tilāwatihi ‘its true recitation’ is a circumstantial qualifier; haqqa is in the accusative because it is the object of the verbal noun they believe in it this is the predicate this was revealed concerning a group of Ethiopians that presented themselves to the Prophet and accepted Islam; and whoever disbelieves in it that is in the revealed Book by distorting it they shall be the losers because they will be destined for the Fire made everlasting for them.
The Cow,2,122,O Children of Israel! Remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and how I preferred you to (all) creatures.,O Children of Israel remember My favour wherewith I favoured you and that I have preferred you over all the worlds a similar verse has already been mentioned.

The Cow,2,124,"And (remember) when his Lord tried Abraham with (His) commands, and he fulfilled them, He said: Lo! I have appointed thee a leader for mankind.

Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer, the Knower.",And mention when Abraham raised up the foundations the supports or the walls of the House building it min al-bayt ‘of the House’ is semantically connected to yarfa‘u ‘raises up’ and Ishmael with him wa-Ismā‘īlu is a supplement to Ibrāhīmu both of them saying ‘Our Lord!

Verily We chose him in the world, and lo! in the Hereafter he is among the righteous.",Who therefore meaning ‘none’ shrinks from the religion of Abraham abandoning it except he who fools himself? that is to say either the one who ignores that his soul has been created for God and that it is obliged to worship Him or the one who treats it with frivolity and degrades it. Indeed We chose him We elected him in this world for prophethood and friendship and in the Hereafter he shall be among the righteous those of the high stations al-darajāt al-‘ulā cf. Q. 2075.
The Cow,2,131,When his Lord said unto him: Surrender! he said: I have surrendered to the Lord of the Worlds.,And mention When his Lord said to him ‘Submit’ obey God and devote your religion purely to Him he said ‘I have submitted to the Lord of the Worlds’.

Allah hath chosen for you the (true) religion; therefore die not save as men who have surrendered (unto Him).",And Abraham enjoined wassā; may also be read awsā upon his sons this creed and so did Jacob upon his sons saying ‘My sons God has chosen for you the true religion the religion of submission to God islām see that you die not save in submission he forbade them from abandoning this submission to God and enjoined them to adhere firmly to it until death overtook them.
The Cow,2,133,"Or were ye present when death came to Jacob, when he said unto his sons: What will ye worship after me ? They said: We shall worship thy God, the God of thy fathers, Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac, One God, and unto Him we have surrendered.",When the Jews said to the Prophet s ‘Do you not know that on the day of his death Jacob charged his sons with Judaism?’ the following was revealed Or were you witnesses present when death came to Jacob? When idh ‘when’ substitutes for the preceding idh he said to his sons ‘What will you worship after me?’ after I die?; They said ‘We will worship your God and the God of your fathers Abraham and Ishmael and Isaac in recognition of the predominant mention of the father figures Ishmael is also counted as a father and also because the status of an uncle is akin to that of a father One God ilāhan wāhidan ‘One God’ substitutes for ilāhaka ‘your God’ to Him we submit’ the initial am of the phrase am kuntum ‘Or were you …’ is similar to the hamza of denial sc. a-kuntum the sense being ‘You were not present at his death so how do you ascribe to him what does not befit him?’.

And ye will not be asked of what they used to do.",That tilka is the subject of this sentence and denotes Abraham Jacob and his sons and is feminine because it agrees with the gender of its predicate is a community that has passed away has gone before; theirs is what they have earned the reward for their deeds lahā mā kasabat theirs is what they have earned’ constitutes the commencement of a new sentence and yours the Jews are being addressed here is what you have earned; you shall not be asked about what they did in the same way that they will not be asked about what you did this latter statement being an affirmation of the former.
The Cow,2,135,"And they say: Be Jews or Christians, then ye will be rightly guided. Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Nay, but (we follow) the religion of Abraham, the upright, and he was not of the idolaters.",And they say ‘Be Jews or Christians the particle aw is for detail; the first of these is the saying of the Medinan Jews while the second is that of the Christians of Najrān and you shall be guided’. Say to them ‘Nay we follow rather the creed of Abraham a hanīf hanīfan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to Ibrāhīma that is to say one that inclines away from all other religions to the upright religion; and he was not of the idolaters’.
The Cow,2,136,"Say (O Muslims): We believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed unto Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes, and that which Moses and Jesus received, and that which the prophets received from their Lord. We make no distinction between any of them, and unto Him we have surrendered.",Say this address is to the believers ‘We believe in God and in that which has been revealed to us the Qur’ān and revealed to Abraham the ten scrolls Ishmael Isaac Jacob and the Tribes his sons and that which was given to Moses the Torah and Jesus the Gospel and the prophets from their Lord of Books and signs we make no division between any of them believing in some and disbelieving in others in the manner of Jews and Christians and to Him we submit’.
The Cow,2,137,"And if they believe in the like of that which ye believe, then are they rightly guided. But if they turn away, then are they in schism, and Allah will suffice thee (for defence) against them. He is the Hearer, the Knower.",And if they the Jews and the Christians believe in the like mithl ‘the like’ is extra of what you believe in then they are truly guided; but if they turn away from belief in it then they are clearly in schism in opposition to you; God will suffice you O Muhammad (s) against them and their schisms; He is the Hearer of their sayings the Knower of their circumstances God sufficed him with regard to them by killing Qurayza expelling Nadīr and exacting the jizya from them.
The Cow,2,138,"(We take our) colour from Allah, and who is better than Allah at colouring. We are His worshippers.",The mark of God sibghata’Llāhi a verbal noun reaffirming the earlier āmannā and it is in the accusative because of the verbal construction implied that is to say sabaghanā’Llāhu ‘God has marked us’ this denotes His religion the one towards which He made human beings naturally inclined as it leaves its mark on a person in the same way that a dye leaves its mark on a garment; and who has that is none has a better mark sibghatan ‘marking’ is for specification than God? And Him we worship the Jews said to the Muslims ‘We are the people of the first Book and our direction of prayer qibla is more ancient and prophets were never sent from among the Arabs; if Muhammad were a prophet he would have been one of us’. Thus the following was revealed
The Cow,2,139,Say (unto the People of the Scripture): Dispute ye with us concerning Allah when He is our Lord and your Lord ? Ours are our works and yours your works. We look to Him alone.,Say to them ‘Would you then dispute with us concerning God that He chose a prophet from among the Arabs and He is our Lord and your Lord? and so it is for Him to choose whom He will Our deeds belong to us for which we will be requited and to you belong your deeds for which you will be requited so that it is not improbable that among our deeds there will be those for which we will deserve to be honoured; and to Him we are sincerely devoted in religion and in deed unlike you hence we are more worthy to be chosen the hamza of a-tuhājjūnanā ‘would you then dispute’ is for rejection and the three clauses that follow it are all circumstantial qualifiers.
The Cow,2,140,"Or say ye that Abraham, and Ishmael, and Isaac, and Jacob, and the tribes were Jews or Christians ? Say: Do ye know best, or doth Allah ? And who is more unjust than he who hideth a testimony which he hath received from Allah ? Allah is not unaware of what ye do.",Or nay do you say taqūlūna also read yaqūlūna ‘do they say?’ ‘Abraham Ishmael Isaac and Jacob and the Tribes — they were Jews or they were Christians?’ Say to them ‘Have you then greater knowledge or has God? that is God has greater knowledge; He dissociated Abraham from both groups when He said Abraham was not a Jew nor a Christian Q. 367; and those mentioned with him Abraham are his followers in not belonging to either group. And who does greater injustice than he who conceals hides from people a testimony he has received from God? that is there is none more unjust than him these are the Jews for they concealed God’s testimony about Abraham’s pure faith in the Torah; And God is not heedless of what you do’ this is a threat for them.
The Cow,2,141,Those are a people who have passed away; theirs is that which they earned and yours that which ye earn. And ye will not be asked of what they used to do.,That is a community that has passed away; theirs is what they have earned and yours is what you have earned; you shall not be asked about what they did a similar verse has already been mentioned above.
The Cow,2,142,The foolish of the people will say: What hath turned them from the qiblah which they formerly observed ? Say: Unto Allah belong the East and the West. He guideth whom He will unto a straight path.,The fools the ignorant among the people that is the Jews and the idolaters will say ‘What matter has turned them the Prophet s and the believers from the direction they were facing in their prayers formerly?’ this being the Holy House bayt al-maqdis sc. Jerusalem; the sīn of sa-yaqūlu ‘they will say’ denotes the future tense and informs of the Unseen. Say ‘To God belong the East and the West that is all directions. Thus He commands that they face whichever direction He wills and there can be no objection. He guides whomever He will His guidance being to a straight path’ that is the religion of Islam and you are among these guided ones.
The Cow,2,143,"Thus We have appointed you a middle nation, that ye may be witnesses against mankind, and that the messenger may be a witness against you. And We appointed the qiblah which ye formerly observed only that We might know him who followeth the messenger, from him who turneth on his heels. In truth it was a hard (test) save for those whom Allah guided. But it was not Allah’s purpose that your faith should be in vain, for Allah is Full of Pity, Merciful toward mankind.",Thus in the same way that We guided you to it We appointed you O community of Muhammad (s) a midmost community excellent and upright that you might be witnesses to the people on the Day of Resurrection that their messengers delivered the Message to them; and that the Messenger might be a witness to you that he delivered the Message to you and We did not appoint make the direction for you now the direction you were facing that is the Ka‘ba the Prophet s used to face it in prayer but when he emigrated he was commanded to face the Holy House of Jerusalem in order to win the hearts of the Jews. He prayed in this direction for sixteen or seventeen months before he changed direction; except that We might know that it become manifest knowledge who followed the Messenger and believed in him from him who turned on his heels and returned to unbelief doubting the religion and thinking that the Prophet s was confused about this issue; and a number of them apostatised as a result of this— though it the change of direction were wa-in ‘though’ is softened and its noun apocopated originally being wa-innahā a grave thing troublesome for people save for those of them whom God has guided; but God would never cause your faith that is your prayers towards the Holy House of Jerusalem to be wasted but He will reward you for them the reason that this verse was revealed was that some had asked about the status of those that had died before the change of direction of prayer; truly God is Gentle with believing people Merciful when He does not let their deeds go to waste al-ra’fa means ‘intensity of mercy’ and is mentioned first to allow for the end rhyme of the verse with the preceding one.
The Cow,2,144,"We have seen the turning of thy face to heaven (for guidance, O Muhammad). And now verily We shall make thee turn (in prayer) toward a qiblah which is dear to thee. So turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship, and ye (O Muslims), wheresoever ye may be, turn your faces (when ye pray) toward it. Lo! Those who have received the Scripture know that (this revelation) is the Truth from their Lord. And Allah is not unaware of what they do.",We have indeed qad ‘indeed’ is for affirmation seen you turning your face about in the direction of the heaven looking around for the Revelation and longing for the command to face the Ka‘ba he the Prophet wished for this because it was the prayer-direction of Abraham and would be more conducive to the submission of the Arabs to Islam; now We will surely turn you to a direction that shall satisfy you that you will love. Turn your face in prayer towards the Sacred Mosque that is the Ka‘ba and wherever you are addressing the Muslim community turn your faces in prayer towards it. Those who have been given the Scripture know that it the change towards the Ka‘ba is the fixed truth from their Lord on account of the description in their Scripture of how the Prophet s would re-orient himself to it; God is not heedless of what you do O believers when you obey His command alternatively ta‘malūna ‘you do’ can be read ya‘malūna ‘they do’ in other words it would be referring to the Jews’ denial of the matter concerning the direction of prayer.
The Cow,2,145,"And even if thou broughtest unto those who have received the Scripture all kinds of portents, they would not follow thy qiblah, nor canst thou be a follower of their qiblah; nor are some of them followers of the qiblah of others. And if thou shouldst follow their desires after the knowledge which hath come unto thee, then surely wert thou of the evil- doers.",Yet if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you should bring to those who have been given the Scripture every sign about your truthfulness in the matter of the direction of prayer they will not follow your direction out of obduracy and you are not a follower of their direction this is a categorical negation of his the Prophet’s desire that they become Muslims and of their desire that he return to their direction of prayer; neither are they the Jews and the Christians followers of one another’s direction. If you were to follow their whims the ones to which they summon you after the knowledge the revelation that has come to you then you if hypothetically you were to follow them will surely be among the evildoers.
The Cow,2,146,Those unto whom We gave the Scripture recognise (this revelation) as they recognise their sons. But lo! a party of them knowingly conceal the truth.,Those to whom We have given the Scripture they recognise him Muhammad (s) as they recognise their sons because of the descriptions of him in their Scripture ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Salām said ‘I recognised him the moment I saw him as I would my own son; but my recognition of Muhammad (s) was more intense’; even though there is a party of them that conceal the truth that is his description while they know this truth which you Muhammad (s) follow.
The Cow,2,147,"It is the Truth from thy Lord (O Muhammad), so be not thou of those who waver.",The truth comes from your Lord; then be not among the doubters who doubt it that is to say ‘be not of such a disposition’ which is more eloquent than merely saying ‘do not waver’.
The Cow,2,148,"And each one hath a goal toward which he turneth; so vie with one another in good works. Wheresoever ye may be, Allah will bring you all together. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.",Every person of every community has his direction wijha his qibla to which he turns muwallīhā ‘he turns to it’ is also read as muwallāhā ‘he is made to turn to it’ in his prayers so vie with one another in good works strive with acts of obedience and acceptance of these. Wherever you may be God will bring you all together gathering you on the Day of Resurrection and requiting you for your deeds; surely God has power over all things.
The Cow,2,149,"And whencesoever thou comest forth (for prayer, O Muhammad) turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship. Lo! it is the Truth from thy Lord. Allah is not unaware of what ye do.",From whatever place you issue on a journey turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; it is the truth from your Lord. God is not heedless of what you do ta‘malūna ‘you do’ may also be read as ya‘malūna ‘they do’ as already appears above sc. 2144; its repetition is intended to point out that the stipulation applies equally to being on a journey or otherwise.
The Cow,2,150,"Whencesoever thou comest forth turn thy face toward the Inviolable Place of Worship; and wheresoever ye may be (O Muslims) turn your faces toward it (when ye pray) so that men may have no argument against you, save such of them as do injustice - Fear them not, but fear Me! - and so that I may complete My grace upon you, and that ye may be guided.",From whatever place you issue turn your face towards the Sacred Mosque; and wherever you may be turn your faces towards it all of which is being repeated for emphasis so that there be not any argument from the people the Jews or the idolaters against you so that there be not any cause for contention regarding the change to a different direction of prayer. In this way their contentions against you will cease to exist both the contentions of the Jews when they say ‘He Muhammad (s) rejects our religion but follows our direction of prayer’ and of the idolaters when they say ‘He Muhammad (s) claims to follow the creed of Abraham but he contravenes his Abraham’s qibla’; excepting the evildoers among them acting in obstinacy who will say ‘He Muhammad (s) only changed to this direction because of his natural inclination towards the idolatrous religion of his forefathers’. The exceptive statement indicated by illā is a continuous one the meaning being ‘No one will have anything to say against you except for what these people say’; and do not fear them do not fear their arguing with you regarding the change to it the Ka‘ba but fear Me by complying with My command; and that I may perfect My grace upon you by guiding you to the principal rituals of your religion and that you may be guided to the truth wa-li-utimma ‘that I may perfect’ is a supplement to li-allā yakūna ‘that there be not’.
The Cow,2,151,"Even as We have sent unto you a messenger from among you, who reciteth unto you Our revelations and causeth you to grow, and teacheth you the Scripture and wisdom, and teacheth you that which ye knew not.",As also We have sent this verbal clause ka-mā arsalnā ‘as We have sent’ is semantically connected to wa-li-utimma of the previous verse that is to say ‘Also We have sent by way of perfection’; as it My grace has been perfected by Our sending among you of yourselves Muhammad (s) a messenger to recite Our verses the Qur’ān to you and to purify you to cleanse you from idolatry and to teach you the Book the Qur’ān and wisdom the rulings therein and to teach you what you knew not.
The Cow,2,152,"Therefore remember Me, I will remember you. Give thanks to Me, and reject not Me.",So remember Me through prayer glorification and the like I will remember you this is said to mean ‘I will reward you’; in a hadīth about God that He says ‘whoever remembers Me in himself I will remember him in Myself and whoever remembers Me in an assembly I will remember him in an Assembly more excellent than his’; and be thankful to Me for My grace by being obedient and be not ungrateful towards Me through disobedience.
The Cow,2,153,O ye who believe! Seek help in steadfastness and prayer. Lo! Allah is with the steadfast.,O you who believe seek help regarding the Hereafter through patience in obedience and afflictions and prayer He singles it out for mention on account of its frequency and its greatness; surely God is with the patient helping them.
The Cow,2,154,"And call not those who are slain in the way of Allah ""dead."" Nay, they are living, only ye perceive not.",And say not of those slain in God’s way that ‘They are dead’; rather they are living their spirits are according to a hadīth contained in green birds that take wing freely wherever they wish in Paradise; but you are not aware but you do not know their condition.
The Cow,2,155,"And surely We shall try you with something of fear and hunger, and loss of wealth and lives and crops; but give glad tidings to the steadfast,",Surely We will try you with something of fear of an enemy and hunger by way of drought and diminution of goods as a result of destruction and lives as a result of slaughter death and disease and fruits by way of crop damage that is to say We will try you to see if you practise patience or not; yet give good tidings of Paradise to the patient during calamities;
The Cow,2,156,"Who say, when a misfortune striketh them: Lo! we are Allah’s and lo! unto Him we are returning.",those who when they are struck by an affliction a calamity say ‘Surely we belong to God we are His possession and servants with whom He does as He pleases; and to Him we will return’ in the Hereafter whereupon He will requite us in one hadīth it is said that ‘whoever pronounces the istirjā‘ sc. the formula ‘surely we belong to God and to Him we will return’ when an affliction befalls him God will reward him and compensate him with what is better’. Similarly it is said that on one occasion when his lamp blew out the Prophet s uttered the istirjā‘ whereupon ‘Ā’isha said to him saying ‘But it is just a lamp’ to which he replied ‘Whatever bothers a believer is an affliction of sorts’ this is reported by Abū Dāwūd in his section on mursal reports.
The Cow,2,157,"Such are they on whom are blessings from their Lord, and mercy. Such are the rightly guided.",Upon those rest blessings forgiveness and mercy grace from their Lord and those — they are the truly guided to rectitude.
The Cow,2,158,"Lo! (the mountains) As-Safa and Al-Marwah are among the indications of Allah. It is therefore no sin for him who is on pilgrimage to the House (of God) or visiteth it, to go around them (as the pagan custom is). And he who doeth good of his own accord, (for him) lo! Allah is Responsive, Aware.",Truly Safā and Marwa two mountains near Mecca are among the waymarks sha‘ā’ir plural of sha‘īra of God the ritual ceremonies of His religion so whoever makes the Pilgrimage to the House or the Visitation that is whoever prepares to perform the Pilgrimage hajj or the Visitation ‘umra the original sense of both terms hajja and i‘tamara is ‘to aim for’ and ‘to visit’ respectively; he would not be at fault it would not be a sin if he circumambulates them the original tā’ of yatatawwafa ‘circumambulate’ has been assimilated with the tā’ by pacing quickly sa‘y between them seven times this was revealed when the Muslims were averse to this circumambulation because the pagan Arabs used to circumambulate them and there was an idol atop each mountain which they used to stroke. It is reported from Ibn ‘Abbās that this pacing between the two is not obligatory based on the fact that when no sin can be incurred the context implies free choice. Al-Shāfi‘ī and others however considered it to be a pillar of the Pilgrimage rituals. The Prophet made clear its obligatory aspect when he said that ‘God has prescribed for you the pacing sa‘y’ as reported by al-Bayhaqī and others; and he the Prophet also said ‘Begin with what God has begun’ meaning al-Safā as reported by Muslim; and whoever volunteers tatawwa‘a a variant reading is yattawa‘ the ta’ here being assimilated good that is any good deed such as circumambulation or other that is not obligatory on him; God is Grateful for such a deed and rewards that person for it Knowing it.
The Cow,2,159,"Lo! Those who hide the proofs and the guidance which We revealed, after We had made it clear to mankind in the Scripture: such are accursed of Allah and accursed of those who have the power to curse.",The following was revealed concerning the Jews Those who conceal from people the clear proofs and the guidance that We have revealed such as the ‘stoning’ verse and the description of Muhammad (s) after We have shown them clearly in the Scripture the Torah — they shall be cursed by God that is He will move them far away from His mercy and by the cursers the angels believers or by every single thing when they supplicate that they be cursed.
The Cow,2,160,"Except those who repent and amend and make manifest (the truth). These it is toward whom I relent. I am the Relenting, the Merciful.",Except those that repent turning back from such deeds and make amends in their actions and show clearly what they were concealing — them I shall turn relenting accepting their repentance; I am the Relenting the Merciful to believers.
The Cow,2,161,"Lo! Those who disbelieve, and die while they are disbelievers; on them is the curse of Allah and of angels and of men combined.",But those who disbelieve and die disbelieving wa-hum kuffār ‘they being disbelievers’ is a circumstantial qualifier — upon them shall be the curse of God and the angels and of people altogether that is they deserve such a curse in this life and in the next; ‘people’ here is said to be either people in general or believers.
The Cow,2,162,"They ever dwell therein. The doom will not be lightened for them, neither will they be reprieved.",Abiding therein that is in the curse and the Fire the latter indicated by the following words the chastisement shall not be lightened for them not even for a blink of an eye no respite shall be given them in which to have time to repent or to excuse themselves.
The Cow,2,163,"Your God is One God; there is no God save Him, the Beneficent, the Merciful.",When they asked him Muhammad (s) to describe his Lord the following was revealed Your God the One deserving of your worship is One God without any equal in either essence or attribute; there is no god except Him He is the Compassionate the Merciful.
The Cow,2,164,"Lo! In the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of night and day, and the ships which run upon the sea with that which is of use to men, and the water which Allah sendeth down from the sky, thereby reviving the earth after its death, and dispersing all kinds of beasts therein, and (in) the ordinance of the winds, and the clouds obedient between heaven and earth: are signs (of Allah’s Sovereignty) for people who have sense.",They then asked for a sign to prove this and the following was revealed Surely in the creation of the heavens and the earth and the marvels contained in them and the alternation of the night and day passing and returning increasing and diminishing and the ships that run in the sea and do not become cracked and sink with what profits men of trade and merchandise and the water the rain God sends down from the heaven with which He revives the earth with vegetation after it is dead after it has dried out and He scatters abroad in it all manner of crawling thing by dividing them and spreading them throughout on account of the vegetation for they thrive on the fertile pastures it produces; and the disposition of the winds changing it from south to north from cold to warm and the clouds compelled subjugated by God’s command moving to wherever God wishes between heaven and the earth without being attached to either of the two — surely there are signs indicating His Oneness exalted be He for a people who comprehend a people who contemplate.
The Cow,2,165,"Yet of mankind are some who take unto themselves (objects of worship which they set as) rivals to Allah, loving them with a love like (that which is the due) of Allah (only) - those who believe are stauncher in their love for Allah - Oh, that those who do evil had but known, (on the day) when they behold the doom, that power belongeth wholly to Allah, and that Allah is severe in punishment!",Yet there be people who take to themselves compeers idols besides God that is other than God loving them by magnifying them and being subservient to them as God is loved that is as their love of Him; but those who believe love God more ardently than those who love their compeers because the former never reject God whereas the latter when faced with hardship soon abandon those compeers for God; If he if you O Muhammad (s) were to see those who did evil by taking to themselves compeers when idh here denotes idhā they see read either as active yarawna ‘they see’ or passive yurawna ‘they are made to see’ the chastisement you would see a grave sight that this is because the might the power and the vanquishing altogether a circumstantial qualifier belongs to God and that God is terrible in chastisement according to one reading the person listening to the verse governs the verb yarā ‘he sees’ and constitutes the subject of the clause; according to another reading it is the ‘evildoers’ who constitute the subject of the clause and govern the verb yarā; and so it yarā has the sense of ya‘lam ‘he knows’; the particle an ‘that’ and what comes after it have taken the place of the objects in both cases; the response to the initial conditional law ‘if’ has been omitted. The general meaning of the verse then is ‘If they were aware in this world of the severity of God’s chastisement and of the fact that power is God’s alone the moment they come to see it with their own eyes on the Day of Resurrection they would not take to themselves compeers’.
The Cow,2,166,"(On the day) when those who were followed disown those who followed (them), and they behold the doom, and all their aims collapse with them.",When idh here substitutes for the previous idh those who were followed that is the leaders disown their followers that is to say when they have denied misleading them the latter and they have seen the chastisement and the cords the bonds of affection and kinship that were between them on earth are cut away before them from them taqatta‘at ‘cut away’ is a supplement to tabarra’a ‘disown’.
The Cow,2,167,"And those who were but followers will say: If a return were possible for us, we would disown them even as they have disowned us. Thus will Allah show them their own deeds as anguish for them, and they will not emerge from the Fire.",And those who followed say ‘O if only we might return again to the world and disown them the ones who had been followed as they have disowned us!’ on this day the particle law ‘if only’ is an optative and its response is natabarra’a ‘we disown’. So just as He showed them the severity of His chastisement and their disowning of one another so too God shall show them their evil works as anguish hasarāt is a circumstantial qualifier regrets for them! Never shall they exit from the Fire once they have entered it.
The Cow,2,168,"O mankind! Eat of that which is lawful and wholesome in the earth, and follow not the footsteps of the devil. Lo! he is an open enemy for you.",The following was revealed when some said that it was unlawful to take a camel that has been let loose sawā’ib O people eat of what is in the earth lawful halālan is a circumstantial qualifier and wholesome tayyiban is an adjective for emphasis that is to say what is delicious; and follow not the steps the ways of Satan meaning what he embellishes of temptations; he is a manifest foe to you whose enmity is clear;
The Cow,2,169,"He enjoineth upon you only the evil and the foul, and that ye should tell concerning Allah that which ye know not.",he only commands you to evil sin and indecency what is abhorred by the Law and that you should speak against God what you do not know such as forbidding what He has not forbidden and otherwise.
The Cow,2,170,"And when it is said unto them: Follow that which Allah hath revealed, they say: We follow that wherein we found our fathers. What! Even though their fathers were wholly unintelligent and had no guidance ?",And when it is said to them the disbelievers ‘Follow what God has revealed’ pertaining to affirmation of God’s Oneness and the good things that He has made lawful they say ‘No; but we follow what we found our fathers doing’ in the way of idol-worship deeming unlawful the camel let loose and practising the slitting of the camel’s ear sc. bahīra. God says What? the hamza of a-wa-law is for repudiation do they follow them Even if their fathers do not understand anything concerning religion and they were not guided? to the truth.
The Cow,2,171,"The likeness of those who disbelieve (in relation to the messenger) is as the likeness of one who calleth unto that which heareth naught except a shout and cry. Deaf, dumb, blind, therefore they have no sense.",The likeness the attribute of those who disbelieve and the one who calls them to guidance is as the likeness of one who shouts to that which hears nothing save a call and a cry only a sound not understanding its meaning when they listen to an admonition they are like cattle that hear the cry of their shepherd but do not understand what he is saying; they are deaf dumb blind — they do not comprehend any admonition.
The Cow,2,172,"O ye who believe! Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you, and render thanks to Allah if it is (indeed) He Whom ye worship.",O you who believe eat of the good things that are lawful wherewith We have provided you and give thanks to God for what He has made lawful for you if it be Him that you worship.
The Cow,2,173,"He hath forbidden you only carrion, and blood, and swineflesh, and that which hath been immolated to (the name of) any other than Allah. But he who is driven by necessity, neither craving nor transgressing, it is no sin for him. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.",He has only forbidden you carrion that is the consumption of it since this is the subject of the general address here and similarly the consumption of what follows all of which is what has not been slaughtered in accordance with prescriptions of the Law; to this the Sunna adds as also constituting carrion what has been severed from a living creature. A special status is however accorded fish and locusts; blood poured forth as in sūrat al-An‘ām see Q. 6145 the flesh of swine the meat is singled out for mention because that part is what people mostly seek every other part being implied thereby; what has been hallowed to other than God that is to say what has been slaughtered in other than His Name al-ihlāl is the raising of one’s voice which they used to do when sacrificing for their gods. Yet whoever is constrained forced by dire need to eat of the above-mentioned not desiring to rebel against Muslims nor transgressing committing aggression against them by waylaying them no sin shall be on him for eating it. God is Forgiving to His friends Merciful to those who are obedient to Him for He has granted them wide berth in this matter. The aggressor and the transgressor are excluded from this dispensation and to these two categories one should also add every person that sets out on a journey in disobedience such as the fugitive or the excise collector for whom it would be unlawful to eat any of the mentioned unless they repent of their disobedience; this is the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī.
The Cow,2,174,"Lo! those who hide aught of the Scripture which Allah hath revealed and purchase a small gain therewith, they eat into their bellies nothing else than fire. Allah will not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection, nor will He make them grow. Theirs will be a painful doom.",Those who conceal what God has revealed of the Scripture comprising all the descriptions of Muhammad (s) meaning the Jews and sell it for a little price in this world taking this little price in its place from the debased ones among them for fear of losing out if they were to manifest it sc. the truth of Muhammad (s) — they shall consume nothing in their bellies but the Fire because that is their journey’s end; God shall not speak to them on the Day of Resurrection out of anger with them neither purify them from the filth of sin; and theirs is a painful chastisement that is the Fire.
The Cow,2,175,"Those are they who purchase error at the price of guidance, and torment at the price of pardon. How constant are they in their strife to reach the Fire!",Those are they that have bought error at the price of guidance taking the former in place of the latter in this world and chastisement at the price of pardon the pardon that would have been prepared for them in the Hereafter had they not concealed this matter; what makes them so patient for the Fire? that is how great is the extent of their patience? This statement is intended to provoke amazement in the believers at the way in which they the disbelievers commit sins that necessitate their punishment in the Fire with complete indifference. In reality they would have no patience whatever to endure the Fire.
The Cow,2,176,That is because Allah hath revealed the Scripture with the truth. Lo! those who find (a cause of) disagreement in the Scripture are in open schism.,That which has been mentioned of their eating of the Fire and what follows it is because God has revealed the Book with the truth but they are at variance regarding it believing in parts of it while disbelieving in others and concealing them; and those that are at variance regarding the Book concerning this matter namely the Jews — although it is said that these are the idolaters some of whom said with regard to the Qur’ān that it was poetry others that it was sorcery and others still that it was divination — are in schism disagreement far removed from the truth.
The Cow,2,177,"It is not righteousness that ye turn your faces to the East and the West; but righteous is he who believeth in Allah and the Last Day and the angels and the Scripture and the prophets; and giveth wealth, for love of Him, to kinsfolk and to orphans and the needy and the wayfarer and to those who ask, and to set slaves free; and observeth proper worship and payeth the poor-due. And those who keep their treaty when they make one, and the patient in tribulation and adversity and time of stress. Such are they who are sincere. Such are the God-fearing.",It is not piety that you turn your faces in prayer to the East and to the West. This was revealed in response to the claim made by the Jews and the Christians to this effect. True piety that is the pious person al-birr is also read al-barr in the sense of al-bārr ‘the dutiful person’ is that of the one who believes in God and the Last Day and the angels and the Book that is the scriptures and the prophets and who gives of his substance however despite it being cherished by him to kinsmen and orphans and the needy and the traveller and beggars and for the setting free of slaves both the captive and the one to be manumitted by contract; and who observes prayer and pays the alms that are obligatory and what was given before alms were made obligatory in the way of charity; and those who fulfil their covenant when they have engaged in a covenant with God or with others those who endure with fortitude al-sābirīna is the accusative of laudation misfortune al-ba’sā’ is abject poverty hardship illness and peril at the height of a battle in the way of God; these described in the way mentioned are the ones who are truthful in their faith and in their claims to piety and these are the ones who are fearful of God.
The Cow,2,178,"O ye who believe! Retaliation is prescribed for you in the matter of the murdered; the freeman for the freeman, and the slave for the slave, and the female for the female. And for him who is forgiven somewhat by his (injured) brother, prosecution according to usage and payment unto him in kindness. This is an alleviation and a mercy from your Lord. He who transgresseth after this will have a painful doom.",O you who believe prescribed made obligatory for you is retaliation on equal terms regarding the slain both in the attributes of the one slain and in the action involved; a free man is killed for a free man and not for a slave; and a slave for a slave and a female for a female. The Sunna makes it clear that a male may be killed in retaliation for a female and that religious affiliation should be taken into account also so that a Muslim cannot be killed in return for an disbeliever even if the former be a slave and the latter a free man. But if anything of the blood is pardoned any one of those who have slain in relation to his brother the one slain so that the retaliation is waived the use of the indefinite shay’un ‘anything’ here implies the waiving of retaliation through a partial pardon by the inheritors of the slain; the mention of akhīh ‘his brother’ is intended as a conciliatory entreaty to pardon and a declaration that killing should not sever the bonds of religious brotherhood; the particle man ‘any one’ is the subject of a conditional or a relative clause of which the predicate is the following fa’ittibā‘un let the pursuing that is the action of the one who has pardoned in pursuing the killer be honourable demanding the blood money without force. The fact that the ‘pursuing’ results from the ‘pardoning’ implies that one of the two actions is a duty which is one of al-Shāfi‘ī’s two opinions here. The other opinion is that retaliation is the duty whereas the blood money is merely compensation for non-retaliation so that if one were to pardon but not name his blood money then nothing happens; and this latter is the preferred opinion. And let the payment of the blood money by the slayer to him the pardoner that is the one inheriting from the slain be with kindliness without procrastination or fraud; that stipulation mentioned here about the possibility of retaliation and the forgoing of this in return for blood money is an alleviation a facilitation given to you by your Lord and a mercy for you for He has given you latitude in this matter and has not categorically demanded that one of the said options be followed through in the way that He made it obligatory for Jews to retaliate and for Christians to pardon and accept blood money; and for him who commits aggression by being unjust towards the killer and slaying him after that that is after pardoning — his is a painful chastisement of the Fire in the Hereafter or of being killed in this world.
The Cow,2,179,"And there is life for you in retaliation, O men of understanding, that ye may ward off (evil).",In retaliation there is life for you that is great longevity O people of pith possessors of intellect because if the would-be killer knew that he would be killed in retaliation he would refrain from such action and would have thereby given life to himself and to the one whom he had intended to kill; and so it retaliation was stipulated by the Law so that you might fear killing fearing retaliation.
The Cow,2,180,"It is prescribed for you, when death approacheth one of you, if he leave wealth, that he bequeath unto parents and near relatives in kindness. (This is) a duty for all those who ward off (evil).",Prescribed made obligatory for you when any of you is approached by death that is by its causes and leaves behind some good material possessions is to make testament al-wasiyyatu is in the nominative because of kutiba and is semantically connected to the particle idhā ‘when’ if the latter is adverbial; but if this latter is conditional then it al-wasiyyatu indicates the response; the response to the conditional particle in ‘if’ is in other words implied to be fa’l-yūsi ‘let him make testament’; in favour of his parents and kinsmen honourably that is justly not giving more than the allotted share of a third nor preferring the richer person — an obligation haqqan here emphasises the import of what has preceded on those that fear God this verse has been abrogated by the ‘inheritance’ verse āyat al-mīrāth see Q. 411 and by the hadīth ‘Do not make testament for one already inheriting’ as reported by al-Tirmidhī.
The Cow,2,181,"And whoso changeth (the will) after he hath heard it - the sin thereof is only upon those who change it. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower.",Then if anyone whether a witness or a trustee changes it that is the testament after hearing it and knowing it the sin resulting from the changed testament shall rest upon those who change it here the explicit subject stands in place of the implicit one; surely God is Hearing of the testator’s words Knowing of the deeds of the trustee requiting each accordingly.
The Cow,2,182,"But he who feareth from a testator some unjust or sinful clause, and maketh peace between the parties, (it shall be) no sin for him. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.",But if any one fears injustice an error in straying from what is right or sin because he has purposely increased the share of a third or specified a rich individual from one making testament read mūsī or muwassī and so makes things right between them the testator and the trustee by commanding that justice be done then no sin shall be upon him with regard to this matter; surely God is Forgiving Merciful.
The Cow,2,183,"O ye who believe! Fasting is prescribed for you, even as it was prescribed for those before you, that ye may ward off (evil);",O you who believe prescribed for you obligatory for you is the Fast just as it was prescribed for those communities that were before you so that you might guard yourselves against acts of disobedience for it the fast curbs the desires that prompt these acts.
The Cow,2,184,"(Fast) a certain number of days; and (for) him who is sick among you, or on a journey, (the same) number of other days; and for those who can afford it there is a ransom: the feeding of a man in need - but whoso doeth good of his own accord, it is better for him: and that ye fast is better for you if ye did but know -",For days ayyāman ‘days’ is in the accusative as the object of al-siyām ‘the fast’ or of an implied yasūmū ‘he fasts’ numbered few or specific in number that is those of Ramadān as will be mentioned below; God has specified a small number as a way of facilitating matters for those under the obligation; and if any of you during the month be sick or be on a journey in which prayers are shortened or if one is strained by the fast in both cases and breaks it then a number of other days equal to the ones during which he broke his fast — let him fast them instead; and for those who are not able to do it to fast on account of old age or chronic illness a redemption which is the feeding of a poor man with about the same amount one consumes in a given day that is one mudd measure of the principal food of that town each day a variant reading has genitive fidyatin as an explicative clause. It is also said that the lā negation of the verb yutīqūnahu is not actually implied because at the very beginning of Islam they could choose between fasting or offering the redemption; but later on this was abrogated by fixing the Fast as an obligation where God says So let those of you who are present at the month fast it Q. 2185 Ibn ‘Abbās said by way of qualification ‘Except for the pregnant one and the one breastfeeding if they break their fast out of concern for the child; in the case of these two the verse remains valid and has not been abrogated’. For him who volunteers good by offering more than the minimum amount mentioned for the redemption; that volunteering is good for him; but that you should fast wa-an tasūmū is the subject is better for you khayrun lakum is its predicate than breaking the fast and paying the redemption if you but knew that this is better for you then do it.
The Cow,2,185,"The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur’an, a guidance for mankind, and clear proofs of the guidance, and the Criterion (of right and wrong). And whosoever of you is present, let him fast the month, and whosoever of you is sick or on a journey, (let him fast the same) number of other days. Allah desireth for you ease; He desireth not hardship for you; and (He desireth) that ye should complete the period, and that ye should magnify Allah for having guided you, and that peradventure ye may be thankful.",These days of the month of Ramadān wherein the Qur’ān was revealed from the Preserved Tablet to the earthly heaven on the Night of Ordainment laylat al-qadr from Him a guidance hudan ‘a guidance’ is a circumstantial qualifier guiding away from error for the people and as clear proofs lucid verses of the Guidance the rulings that guide to truth and of the Criterion that discriminates between truth and falsehood; So let those of you who are present at the month fast it and if any of you be sick or if he be on a journey then a number of other days this concession has already been mentioned but it is repeated here to avoid the mistaken impression that it has been abrogated by the comprehensive implication of man shahida ‘who are present’. God desires ease for you and desires not hardship for you and for this reason He has permitted you the breaking of the fast during illness or travel this ease being the very reason He has commanded you to fast; He supplements the previous statement with and that you fulfil read tukmilū or tukammilū the number of the fasting days of Ramadān and magnify God when you have completed them for having guided you for having directed you to the principal rites of His religion and that you might be thankful to God for this.
The Cow,2,186,"And when My servants question thee concerning Me, then surely I am nigh. I answer the prayer of the suppliant when he crieth unto Me. So let them hear My call and let them trust in Me, in order that they may be led aright.",A group of followers of the Prophet s asked him ‘Is our Lord nearby so that we should talk to Him secretly or is He far away so that we should call out to him?’ and the following was revealed And when My servants question you concerning Me — I am near to them in My knowledge and he informed them of this; I answer the call of the caller by granting him his request when he calls to Me; so let them respond to Me My call to them to be obedient and let them believe let them persevere in faith in Me that they might go aright that they might become guided.
The Cow,2,187,"It is made lawful for you to go in unto your wives on the night of the fast. They are raiment for you and ye are raiment for them. Allah is Aware that ye were deceiving yourselves in this respect and He hath turned in mercy toward you and relieved you. So hold intercourse with them and seek that which Allah hath ordained for you, and eat and drink until the white thread becometh distinct to you from the black thread of the dawn. Then strictly observe the fast till nightfall and touch them not, but be at your devotions in the mosques. These are the limits imposed by Allah, so approach them not. Thus Allah expoundeth His revelation to mankind that they may ward off (evil).",Permitted to you upon the night of the Fast is to go in to your wives in sexual intercourse this was revealed as an abrogation of its unlawfulness during the earliest phase of Islam as well as an abrogation of the unlawfulness of eating and drinking after the night prayer; they are a vestment for you and you are a vestment for them a metaphor for their embraces or their need for one another; God knows that you have been betraying yourselves by having sexual intercourse on the eve of the fast this happened with ‘Umar b. al-Khattāb and others and they apologised to the Prophet s and so He has turned to you relenting before you even turned in repentance and He has pardoned you. So now when it is permitted to you lie with them in sexual intercourse and seek what God has prescribed for you of sexual intercourse or what it produces of offspring; and eat and drink at any time during the night until the white thread is distinct to you from the black thread at daybreak that is the true moment of daybreak which explains the white thread while the explanation of the black thread namely the night has been left out. The whiteness and the darkness of the dawn twilight are likened to two black and white threads in the way they stretch out; then complete the fast from daybreak to the night that is until it arrives after the setting of the sun; and do not lie with them your women while you cleave to the mosques in devotion to God while you are residing therein with the intention of performing i‘tikāf ‘spiritual retreat’. This was a prohibition pertaining to one who used to leave the mosque whilst in a state of i‘tikāf have sexual intercourse with his wife and then return. Those rulings mentioned are God’s bounds delimited by God for His servants so that they do not overstep them; do not approach them lā taqrabūhā is more intense than lā ta‘taddūhā ‘Do not overstep’ used in verses elsewhere. So just as He makes clear to you what has been mentioned God makes clear His signs to people so that they might fear disobeying His prohibitions.
The Cow,2,188,"And eat not up your property among yourselves in vanity, nor seek by it to gain the hearing of the judges that ye may knowingly devour a portion of the property of others wrongfully.",Consume not your goods between you that is to say do not let one consume the goods of the other in deception that which is illicit according to the Law such as theft and extortion; and do not proffer them the regulation of these goods or any bribes to the judges that you may consume as a result of any arbitration a portion of other people’s goods embroiled in sin while you are aware that you are in error.
The Cow,2,189,"They ask thee, (O Muhammad), of new moons, say: They are fixed seasons for mankind and for the pilgrimage. It is not righteousness that ye go to houses by the backs thereof (as do the idolaters at certain seasons), but the righteous man is he who wardeth off (evil). So go to houses by the gates thereof, and observe your duty to Allah, that ye may be successful.",They will ask you O Muhammad (s) about the new moons ahilla plural of hilāl ‘Why do they seem very thin and then wax until they are full of light and then wane again as at the first and are not always the same in the way that the sun is?’ Say to them ‘They are appointed times mawāqīt is the plural of mīqāt for the people for them to know the times for sowing the land for business for their women’s waiting periods their fast and their breaking it and the Pilgrimage’ wa’l-hajji and the Pilgrimage’ is a supplement to li’l-nāsi ‘for the people’ that is to say appointed times by which its season is known for if they the new moons always looked the same none of these things could be known. It is not piety to come to the houses from their backs in your state of pilgrimage inviolability ihrām when you would bore holes in them to enter them and then exit disregarding their doors; they used to do this and claim that it was out of piety; but piety is to fear God by not contravening His commands; so come to the houses by their doors when in a state of pilgrimage inviolability and fear God that you may prosper that you may triumph.
The Cow,2,190,"Fight in the way of Allah against those who fight against you, but begin not hostilities. Lo! Allah loveth not aggressors.",After the Prophet s was prevented from visiting the House in the year of the battle of Hudaybiyya he made a pact with the disbelievers that he would be allowed to return the following year at which time they would vacate Mecca for three days. Having prepared to depart for the Visitation ‘umra he and the believers were concerned that Quraysh would not keep to the agreement and instigate fighting. The Muslims were averse to becoming engaged in fighting while in a state of pilgrimage inviolability in the Sacred Enclosure al-haram and during the sacred months and so the following was revealed And fight in the way of God to elevate His religion with those who fight against you the disbelievers but aggress not against them by initiating the fighting; God loves not the aggressors the ones that overstep the bounds which God has set for them this stipulation was abrogated by the verse of barā’a ‘immunity’ Q. 91 or by His saying below
The Cow,2,191,"And slay them wherever ye find them, and drive them out of the places whence they drove you out, for persecution is worse than slaughter. And fight not with them at the Inviolable Place of Worship until they first attack you there, but if they attack you (there) then slay them. Such is the reward of disbelievers.",And slay them wherever you come upon them and expel them from where they expelled you that is from Mecca and this was done after the Conquest of Mecca; sedition their idolatry is more grievous more serious than slaying them in the Sacred Enclosure or while in a state of pilgrimage inviolability the thing that you greatly feared. But fight them not by the Sacred Mosque that is in the Sacred Enclosure until they should fight you there; then if they fight you there slay them there a variant reading drops the alif in the three verbs sc. wa-lā taqtilūhum hattā yaqtulūkum fa-in qatalūkum so that the sense is ‘slaying’ in all three and not just ‘fighting’ — such killing and expulsion is the requital of disbelievers.
The Cow,2,192,"But if they desist, then lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.",But if they desist from unbelief and become Muslims surely God is Forgiving Merciful to them.
The Cow,2,193,"And fight them until persecution is no more, and religion is for Allah. But if they desist, then let there be no hostility except against wrong-doers.",Fight them till there is no sedition no idolatry and the religion all worship is for God alone and none are worshipped apart from Him; then if they desist from idolatry do not aggress against them. This is indicated by the following words there shall be no enmity no aggression through slaying or otherwise save against evildoers. Those that desist however are not evildoers and should not be shown any enmity.
The Cow,2,194,"The forbidden month for the forbidden month, and forbidden things in retaliation. And one who attacketh you, attack him in like manner as he attacked you. Observe your duty to Allah, and know that Allah is with those who ward off (evil).",The sacred month in return for the sacred month therefore just as they fight you during it kill them during it a response to the Muslims’ consideration of the momentous nature of this matter; holy things hurumāt plural of hurma is what must be treated as sacrosanct demand retaliation in kind if these holy things are violated; whoever commits aggression against you through fighting in the Sacred Enclosure or during a state of ritual purity or in the sacred months then commit aggression against him in the manner that he committed against you the Muslim response is also referred to as ‘aggression’ because that is what it resembles formally; and fear God when avenging yourselves and by renouncing aggression and know that God is with the God-fearing helping and assisting them.
The Cow,2,195,"Spend your wealth for the cause of Allah, and be not cast by your own hands to ruin; and do good. Lo! Allah loveth the beneficent.",And spend in the way of God in obedience to Him in holy struggle and the like; and cast not your own hands yourselves the bā’ of bi-aydīkum ‘with your hands’ is extra into destruction by withholding funds needed for the struggle or abandoning it altogether because this will give your enemy the advantage over you; but be virtuous by spending etc.; God loves the virtuous that is He rewards them.
The Cow,2,196,"Perform the pilgrimage and the visit (to Makka) for Allah. And if ye are prevented, then send such gifts as can be obtained with ease, and shave not your heads until the gifts have reached their destination. And whoever among you is sick or hath an ailment of the head must pay a ransom of fasting or almsgiving or offering. And if ye are in safety, then whosoever contenteth himself with the visit for the pilgrimage (shall give) such gifts as can be had with ease. And whosoever cannot find (such gifts), then a fast of three days while on the pilgrimage, and of seven when ye have returned; that is, ten in all. That is for him whoso folk are not present at the Inviolable Place of Worship. Observe your duty to Allah, and know that Allah is severe in punishment.",Fulfil the Pilgrimage and the Visitation to God by completing them according to their due; but if you are prevented from fulfilling them by an enemy then give such offering as may be feasible for you — a sheep — and do not shave your heads that is do not release yourselves from the state of pilgrimage inviolability until the offering mentioned reaches its place its place of sacrifice that is within the enclosure according to al-Shāfi‘ī; the sacrifice is then made with the intention of releasing oneself from the state of pilgrimage inviolability and is divided among the needy after which the head is shaved and the release is effected. If any of you is sick or has an ailment of the head such as lice or severe pains and has thus shaved his head while in a state of pilgrimage inviolability then incumbent upon him is a redemption by fast for three days or a voluntary almsgiving consisting of three cubic measures of the principal food of the town for six needy persons or a ritual sacrifice that is the slaughter of a sheep aw ‘or’ denotes freedom of choice. To this last has been added the case of the one who shaves his head without excuse because the requirement of redemption is most obvious in his case; but also it is required in the case of one that enjoys without shaving such things as scents attire or oils be it with an excuse or without. When you are secure knowing that the enemy has gone or is not present then whoever enjoys the Visitation having completed it and observed its ritual prohibitions until the Pilgrimage until he enters its ritual inviolability in the relevant months; let his offering be such as is feasible for him such as a sheep that he sacrifices after entering into the state of pilgrimage inviolability ideally on the Day of Sacrifice; or if he finds none because there are none available or because he does not have sufficient funds then incumbent upon him is a fast of three days in the Pilgrimage that is to say in a state of pilgrimage inviolability. In such a case he should enter into the state of pilgrimage inviolability before the seventh of Dhū’l-Hijja but ideally before the sixth because one is discouraged from fasting on the Day of ‘Arafa.
The Cow,2,197,"The pilgrimage is (in) the well-known months, and whoever is minded to perform the pilgrimage therein (let him remember that) there is (to be) no lewdness nor abuse nor angry conversation on the pilgrimage. And whatsoever good ye do Allah knoweth it. So make provision for yourselves (Hereafter); for the best provision is to ward off evil. Therefore keep your duty unto Me, O men of understanding.",The Pilgrimage the time for it is in months well-known Shawwāl Dhū’l-Qa’da and ten nights some say all of Dhū’l Hijja; whoever undertakes upon himself the duty of Pilgrimage during them by entering into the state of pilgrimage inviolability then no lewdness no sexual intercourse for them nor wickedness nor acts of disobedience or disputing or quarrelling in the Pilgrimage a variant reading for fa-lā rafathun wa-lā fusūqun wa-lā jidāla has the accusative for all three nouns sc. fa-lā rafatha wa-lā fusūqa wa-lā jidāla; prohibition is meant in all three cases. Whatever good you do by way of voluntary almsgiving God knows it and will reward you for it. And take provision to suffice you your journey this was revealed regarding the people of Yemen who use to make the Pilgrimage and not take any provisions with them thus becoming a burden for others. But the best provision is piety taqwā ‘piety’ literally ‘guarding’ with which you are able to guard against asking others for things; and fear you Me O people of pith! O possessors of intellect.
The Cow,2,198,"It is no sin for you that ye seek the bounty of your Lord (by trading). But, when ye press on in the multitude from ’Arafat, remember Allah by the sacred monument. Remember Him as He hath guided you, although before ye were of those astray.",You would not be at fault if you should seek bounty sustenance from your Lord by engaging in commerce at the Pilgrimage this was revealed in response to their aversion to such an idea; but when you press on push on from ‘Arafāt having stood in prayer upon it then remember God after the overnight stay at Muzdalifa by repeating the talbiya sc. labbayka Llāhummā labbayk ‘at thy service O God at thy service’ the tahlīl lā ilāha illā Llāh ‘no god but God’ and making supplications at the Sacred Waymark a mountain at the end of Muzdalifa called Quzah. In one hadīth the Prophet s stood there remembering God and supplicating until his face began to glow brightly according to Muslim; and remember Him as He has guided you to the principal rites of His religion and the rituals of His Pilgrimage the kāf of ka-mā ‘as’ is the particle denoting the reason though previously before His guidance you were astray.
The Cow,2,199,"Then hasten onward from the place whence the multitude hasteneth onward, and ask forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.",Then thumma denotes the sequence intended press on O Quraysh from where the people press on that is from ‘Arafa by standing there together with them for they used to stand at Muzdalifa disdaining to stand with other people; and seek God’s forgiveness for your sins; God is Forgiving Merciful to the believers.
The Cow,2,200,"And when ye have completed your devotions, then remember Allah as ye remember your fathers or with a more lively remembrance. But of mankind is he who saith: ""Our Lord! Give unto us in the world,"" and he hath no portion in the Hereafter.",And when you have performed and completed your holy rites that is the devotions pertaining to your pilgrimage having cast stones at the Jamrat al-‘Aqaba performed the circumambulation and stopped at Minā remember God by extolling Him and repeating the takbīr saying Allāhu akbar ‘God is Great’ as you remember your fathers as you used to remember them and boast about them at the end of your pilgrimage or yet more intensely than your remembrance of them ashadda is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier referring to dhikr ‘remembrance’ which itself is in the accusative as the object of udhkurū ‘remember’ because had it come after it it would have functioned as an adjectival phrase. There are some people who say ‘Our Lord give to us our lot in this world’ and they are given it; such people will have no part no lot in the Hereafter.
The Cow,2,201,"And of them (also) is he who saith: ""Our Lord! Give unto us in the world that which is good and in the Hereafter that which is good, and guard us from the doom of Fire.""",And there are others who say ‘Our Lord give to us in this world good a grace and good Paradise in the Hereafter and guard us against the chastisement of the Fire’ by not making us enter it. This former statement depicts the manner of the idolaters while the latter the way of the believers and is intended to encourage people to petition for good in both abodes for which one is promised a reward as He says
The Cow,2,202,For them there is in store a goodly portion out of that which they have earned. Allah is swift at reckoning.,Those — they shall have a portion a reward from as a result of what they have earned the deeds they have performed such as Pilgrimage and supplication; and God is swift at reckoning reckoning with the whole of creation in half a day of this world as one hadīth states.
The Cow,2,203,"Remember Allah through the appointed days. Then whoso hasteneth (his departure) by two days, it is no sin for him, and whoso delayeth, it is no sin for him; that is for him who wardeth off (evil). Be careful of your duty to Allah, and know that unto Him ye will be gathered.",And remember God by making takbīr saying Allāhu akbar ‘God is Great’ while you cast your stones at the Jamarāt during certain days numbered the three days of tashrīq. If any man hastens on his departure from Minā in two days that is on the second day of tashrīq after he has cast his stones that hastening is no sin for him; and if he delays such that he stays until the third night and cast his stones it is not a sin for him that is they have the choice of either for the sin has been precluded in both cases; if he fears God during his pilgrimage — for such a person is truly a pilgrim — and fear God and know that to Him you shall be gathered in the Hereafter that He may requite you for your deeds.

Sharīq a hypocrite who spoke kindly in the presence of the Prophet s swearing that he believed in him and that he loved him and frequently sitting with him. God then revealed his mendacity in this matter. On one occasion he passed by some crops and livestock that belonged to the Muslims and later that night he set fire to them the crops and slaughtered them the livestock. God moreover says
The Cow,2,205,And when he turneth away (from thee) his effort in the land is to make mischief therein and to destroy the crops and the cattle; and Allah loveth not mischief.,And when he turns his back leaving you behind he hastens he walks about the earth to do corruption there and to destroy the tillage and the stock these last two actions are included in such ‘corruption’; and God loves not corruption that is to say it does not please Him.
The Cow,2,206,"And when it is said unto him: Be careful of thy duty to Allah, pride taketh him to sin. Hell will settle his account, an evil resting- place.",And when it is said to him ‘Fear God’ in your actions he is seized by vainglory pride and rage in his sin the one he was commanded to avoid committing. So Hell shall be enough it suffices for him — how evil a cradling a resting place it is!
The Cow,2,207,"And of mankind is he who would sell himself, seeking the pleasure of Allah; and Allah hath compassion on (His) bondmen.",But there are other men who sell themselves expend themselves in obedience to God desiring God’s pleasure this was Suhayb b. Sinān al-Rūmī who emigrated to Medina when the idolaters began to persecute him leaving them all his property; and God is Gentle with His servants for He guides them to what pleases Him.
The Cow,2,208,"O ye who believe! Come, all of you, into submission (unto Him); and follow not the footsteps of the devil. Lo! he is an open enemy for you.",The following verse was revealed regarding ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions who after converting to Islam still observed the Sabbath with reverence and were averse to the consumption of camels O you who believe come all of you into submission read al-salm or al-silm that is Islam; kāffatan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-silm meaning into all of its precepts; and follow not the steps the ways of Satan that is his temptations to you by way of creating divisions; he is a manifest foe to you one whose enmity is obvious.
The Cow,2,209,"And if ye slide back after the clear proofs have come unto you, then know that Allah is Mighty, Wise.",But if you slip and incline away from implementing all of its precepts after the clear proofs the lucid arguments have come to you to the effect that this is the truth know then that God is Mighty and nothing can prevent Him from taking His vengeance against you; Wise in His actions.
The Cow,2,210,Wait they for naught else than that Allah should come unto them in the shadows of the clouds with the angels ? Then the case would be already judged. All cases go back to Allah (for judgment).,What do they those that fail to enter into it sc. Islam completely wait for await that God shall come to them that is His Command; this is similar to where God says or that God’s command should come to pass Q. 1633 meaning His chastisement in the shadows zulal plural of zulla of clouds and the angels? The matter is determined the matter of their destruction has been completed and to God all matters are returned in the Hereafter where He will requite each according to his deeds read passive turja‘u al-umūr ‘matters are returned’ or active tarji‘u al-umūr ‘matters return’.
The Cow,2,211,"Ask of the Children of Israel how many a clear revelation We gave them! He who altereth the grace of Allah after it hath come unto him (for him), lo! Allah is severe in punishment.",Ask O Muhammad (s) the Children of Israel by way of rebuke how many a clear proof manifest ones such as the parting of the sea and the sending down of manna and quails which they exchanged for unbelief did We give them kam ‘how many’ is the interrogative particle linking the second object of the verb sal ‘ask’ and is also the second object of the verb ātaynā ‘We gave’ and its specifier; whoever changes God’s grace that is what God has blessed him with in the way of signs for these constitute the causes of guidance after it has come to him out of unbelief God is severe in retribution against him.
The Cow,2,212,Beautified is the life of the world for those who disbelieve; they make a jest of the believers. But those who keep their duty to Allah will be above them on the Day of Resurrection. Allah giveth without stint to whom He will.,Decked out fair to the disbelievers of Mecca is the life of this world in disguise and they have fallen in love with it; and they deride the believers on account of their poverty the likes of Bilāl al-Habashī ‘Ammār b. Yāsir and Suhayb al-Rūmī mocking them and treating them condescendingly with their wealth; but those who fear idolatry namely those mentioned shall be above them on the Day of Resurrection; and God sustains whomever He will without reckoning with ample sustenance in the Hereafter or in this world when He gives to those that were mocked possession of the property and lives of those that mocked them.
The Cow,2,213,"Mankind were one community, and Allah sent (unto them) prophets as bearers of good tidings and as warners, and revealed therewith the Scripture with the truth that it might judge between mankind concerning that wherein they differed. And only those unto whom (the Scripture) was given differed concerning it, after clear proofs had come unto them, through hatred one of another. And Allah by His Will guided those who believe unto the truth of that concerning which they differed. Allah guideth whom He will unto a straight path.",People were one community in faith but they fell into disagreement and some believed while others disbelieved; then God sent forth the prophets to them as bearers of good tidings of Paradise for the believers and warners of the Fire for the disbelievers; and He revealed with them the Scripture meaning the Books with the truth bi’l-haqqi ‘with the truth’ is semantically connected to anzala ‘He revealed’ that He might decide according to it between people regarding their differences in religion; and only those who had been given it the Scripture so that some believed while others disbelieved differed about it about religion after the clear proofs the manifest arguments for God’s Oneness had come to them min of min ba‘di ‘after’ is semantically connected to ikhtalafa ‘they differed’ and together with what follows should be understood as coming before the exception illā lladhīna ‘only those’; out of insolence on the part of the disbelievers one to another; then God guided those who believed to the truth regarding which min of min al-haqqi ‘of the truth’ here is explicative they were at variance by His leave by His will; and God guides with His guidance whomever He will to a straight path the path of truth.
The Cow,2,214,"Or think ye that ye will enter paradise while yet there hath not come unto you the like of (that which came to) those who passed away before you ? Affliction and adversity befell them, they were shaken as with earthquake, till the messenger (of Allah) and those who believed along with him said: When cometh Allah’s help ? Now surely Allah’s help is nigh.",The following was revealed after the Muslims suffered a trying experience Or did you suppose that you should enter Paradise without there having come upon you the like of what came upon those believers who passed away before you? of trials so that you may endure as they did; a new sentence begins here explaining the previous one They were afflicted by misery extreme poverty and hardship illness and were so convulsed by all types of tribulations that the Messenger and those who believed with him said read yaqūla or yaqūlu not expecting to see any help on account of the extreme hardship afflicting them ‘When will God’s help come?’ the help which we were promised; and God responded to them Ah but surely God’s help is nigh in coming.
The Cow,2,215,"They ask thee, (O Muhammad), what they shall spend. Say: that which ye spend for good (must go) to parents and near kindred and orphans and the needy and the wayfarer. And whatsoever good ye do, lo! Allah is Aware of it.",They will ask you O Muhammad (s) about what they should expend. This was the question posed by ‘Amr b. al-Jamūh. He was a wealthy elderly man and went to ask the Prophet s what and for whom he should expend; Say to them ‘Whatever you expend of good min khayrin ‘of good’ is an explication of mā ‘whatever’ covering small and large amounts and denotes one half of the question represented by the expender; God responds with regard to the one receiving the expenditure this pertaining to the other half of the question in the following it is for parents and kinsmen orphans the needy and the traveller that is they are the most deserving of it; and whatever good you may do by way of expending or otherwise God has knowledge of it’ and will requite it accordingly.
The Cow,2,216,"Warfare is ordained for you, though it is hateful unto you; but it may happen that ye hate a thing which is good for you, and it may happen that ye love a thing which is bad for you. Allah knoweth, ye know not.",Prescribed for you obligatory for you is fighting disbelievers though it be hateful to you by nature because of the hardship involved. Yet it may happen that you hate a thing which is good for you; and it may happen that you love a thing which is bad for you because the soul inclines towards those desires which result in its destruction and its rejection of the religious obligations that would bring about its happiness. Perhaps then even if you are averse to it you will find much good in fighting as a result of victory booty martyrdom or reward; while if you were to reject fighting even if you would like to do so you will find much evil because then you may be subjugated impoverished and denied the reward; God knows what is good for you and you know this not so strive in what He commands you.
The Cow,2,217,"They question thee (O Muhammad) with regard to warfare in the sacred month. Say: Warfare therein is a great (transgression), but to turn (men) from the way of Allah, and to disbelieve in Him and in the Inviolable Place of Worship, and to expel His people thence, is a greater with Allah; for persecution is worse than killing. And they will not cease from fighting against you till they have made you renegades from your religion, if they can. And whoso becometh a renegade and dieth in his disbelief: such are they whose works have fallen both in the world and the Hereafter. Such are rightful owners of the Fire: they will abide therein.",Thus the Prophet s sent forth the first of his raiding parties under the command of ‘Abd Allāh b. Jahsh. They fought against the idolaters and killed ‘Amr b. ‘Abd Allāh Ibn al-Hadramī in the sacred month of Rajab thinking that it was the last day of Jumādā II. The disbelievers reviled them for making fighting lawful in a sacred month and so God revealed the following They ask you about the sacred the forbidden month and fighting in it qitālin fīhi ‘fighting in it’ is an inclusive substitution for al-shahri l-harāmi ‘the sacred month’. Say to them ‘Fighting qitālun is the subject in it is a grave thing kabīr ‘grave’ is the predicate that is heinous in terms of sin; but to bar saddun is the subject people from God’s way His religion and disbelief in Him in God and to bar from the Sacred Mosque that is Mecca and to expel its people the Prophet s and the believers from it — that is graver the predicate of the last subject that is more heinous in terms of sin than fighting in it in God’s sight; and sedition your idolatry is graver than your slaying’ in it. They the disbelievers will not cease to fight against you O believers until so that they turn you from your religion to unbelief if they are able; and whoever of you turns from his religion and dies disbelieving — their good works have failed that is they are invalid in this world and the Hereafter. Thus they will not count for anything and will not result in any reward. The specification of death as a condition is because if that person were to return to Islam again his original deeds would not be invalidated and he will be rewarded for them and he would not have to repeat them deeds such as performing the Pilgrimage al-Shāfi‘ī is of this opinion. Those are the inhabitants of the Fire abiding therein.
The Cow,2,218,"Lo! those who believe, and those who emigrate (to escape the persecution) and strive in the way of Allah, these have hope of Allah’s mercy. Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.",When those of the raiding party of ‘Abd Allāh b. Jahsh thought that although they had been released from the sin of having slain in the sacred month they would not receive any reward the following was revealed Verily the believers and those who emigrate and depart from their homeland and struggle in God’s way in order to elevate His religion — those have hope of God’s compassion His reward; and God is Forgiving of believers Merciful to them.
The Cow,2,219,"They question thee about strong drink and games of chance. Say: In both is great sin, and (some) utility for men; but the sin of them is greater than their usefulness. And they ask thee what they ought to spend. Say: that which is superfluous. Thus Allah maketh plain to you (His) revelations, that haply ye may reflect.",They ask you about wine and divinatory arrows gambling and what the ruling is regarding them. Say to them ‘In both that is in the partaking of both is great sin a variant reading for kabīr ‘great’ has kathīr ‘much’ because of the fighting cursing and swearing that ensue from it; and profit for men by way of delight and enjoyment in wine and acquiring money effortlessly from gambling; but the sin in them that is the degenerate behaviour in which they result is greater graver than the usefulness’. When this verse was revealed some gave up drinking while others persisted until the verse of sūrat al-Mā’ida Q. 590-91 finally made it illicit. And they will ask you what that is to say how much they should expend. Say expend ‘Comfortably’ al-‘afwa in the accusative is also read in the nominative al-‘afwu implying a preceding huwa that is the surplus of your need and do not expend what you need ruining yourselves. So just as He explained to you what has been mentioned God makes clear His signs to you that you might reflect
The Cow,2,220,"Upon the world and the Hereafter. And they question thee concerning orphans. Say: To improve their lot is best. And if ye mingle your affairs with theirs, then (they are) your brothers. Allah knoweth him who spoileth from him who improveth. Had Allah willed He could have overburdened you. Allah is Mighty, Wise.",on the matters of this world and the Hereafter and follow what is best for you in both. They will ask you about orphans and the distress their affair caused them for if they became intimate with them they may slip into error but if they put aside the money due to them and prepare their meals for them separately this would distress them. Say ‘To set their affairs aright in terms of their funds by looking after it and your mingling with them is better’ than you not doing this; and if you intermix with them your funds and theirs they are your brothers in religion and it is only natural for one to intermix his affair with his brother so you do too; God knows well him who works corruption in their property when he intermixes with them from him who sets it aright and God will requite both; and had He willed He would have harassed you and made it difficult for you by prohibiting you from intermixing with them. Surely God is Mighty victorious in His affair Wise in His actions.
The Cow,2,221,"Wed not idolatresses till they believe; for lo! a believing bondwoman is better than an idolatress though she please you; and give not your daughters in marriage to idolaters till they believe, for lo! a believing slave is better than an idolater though he please you. These invite unto the Fire, and Allah inviteth unto the Garden, and unto forgiveness by His grace, and expoundeth His revelations to mankind that haply they may remember.",O Muslims Do not marry idolatresses disbelievers until they believe; a believing slavegirl is better than an idolatress who may be a free woman; this was revealed as a rebuttal of the idea that it was shameful to marry a slavegirl and that it was better to marry an idolatress free woman; though you may admire her because of her beauty and wealth this provision excludes the womenfolk of the People of the Scripture as indicated by the verse Q. 55 lawful to you are the chaste women among those who were given the Scripture. And do not marry off believing women to idolaters until they believe. A believing slave is better than an idolater though you may admire him for his wealth and good looks. Those the people of idolatry call to the Fire because they invite one to perform deeds that merit this and for this reason one should not marry with them; and God calls through the voice of His prophets to Paradise and pardon that is to the deeds that merit these two by His leave by His will so that His call may be heeded by marrying with His friends; and He makes clear His signs to the people so that they might remember that they might be admonished.
The Cow,2,222,"They question thee (O Muhammad) concerning menstruation. Say: It is an illness, so let women alone at such times and go not in unto them till they are cleansed. And when they have purified themselves, then go in unto them as Allah hath enjoined upon you. Truly Allah loveth those who turn unto Him, and loveth those who have a care for cleanness.",They will ask you about the monthly period that is menstruation and the spot in which it occurs and how should one treat women during it. Say ‘It is an ailment filth or the place whence it issues is so; so part with women refrain from sexual intercourse with them in the monthly period in this time or in the part affected; and do not approach them for sexual intercourse until they are pure yathurna or yattahharna the original tā’ of yatatahharna has been assimilated with the tā’ that is until they have cleansed themselves after its cessation; when they have cleansed themselves then come to them in sexual intercourse as God has commanded you’ by avoiding it the female organ during menstruation and not resorting to any other part. Truly God loves that is He rewards and honours those who repent of sins and He loves those who cleanse themselves from impurities.
The Cow,2,223,"Your women are a tilth for you (to cultivate) so go to your tilth as ye will, and send (good deeds) before you for your souls, and fear Allah, and know that ye will (one day) meet Him. Give glad tidings to believers, (O Muhammad).",Your women are a tillage for you that is the place where you sow the seeds of your children; so come to your tillage that is the specified place the front part as in whichever way you wish whether standing up sitting down lying down from the front or the back this was revealed in response to the Jews saying that if a person had vaginal intercourse with his wife from behind the child would be born cross-eyed; and offer for your souls righteous deeds such as saying ‘In the Name of God’ bismillāh when you commence intercourse; and fear God in what He commands and prohibits; and know that you shall meet Him at the Resurrection where He will requite you according to your deeds; and give good tidings of Paradise to the believers who feared Him.
The Cow,2,224,"And make not Allah, by your oaths, a hindrance to your being righteous and observing your duty unto Him and making peace among mankind. Allah is Hearer, Knower.",Do not make God by swearing in His Name a hindrance a cause of impediment in your oaths that is setting up such impediments by swearing in His Name frequently so as not to be pious and God-fearing; in such instances oaths are hateful and result in perjury which requires a redemption effected by doing the opposite of the oath such as performing righteous deeds and so forth which constitute an act of obedience; and to put things right between people this means do not be prevented from doing righteous deeds as mentioned just because you swore against them; nay do them and make redemption; this understanding of the verse is justified by the reason for its revelation namely their refraining from such deeds; surely God is All-Hearing of what you say Knower of your circumstances.
The Cow,2,225,"Allah will not take you to task for that which is unintentional in your oaths. But He will take you to task for that which your hearts have garnered. Allah is Forgiving, Clement.",God will not take you to task for a slip that results in your oaths which is what the tongue utters spontaneously and unintentionally such as ‘By God’ ‘Indeed by God’ in such instances there is no sin and no redemption required; but He will take you to task for what your hearts have earned what their intention is when you commit perjury in your oaths; and God is Forgiving of slips in your oaths Forbearing since He delays the punishment of the one deserving it.
The Cow,2,226,"Those who forswear their wives must wait four months; then, if they change their mind, lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.",For those who forswear their women by swearing that they will not have sexual intercourse with them a wait of four months; if they revert back from the oath or repeal it and resume sexual relations God is Forgiving of the harm they caused their women by swearing Merciful to them.
The Cow,2,227,"And if they decide upon divorce (let them remember that) Allah is Hearer, Knower.",But if they resolve upon divorce by not repealing it then let them go through with it; surely God is Hearing of what they say; Knowing of their resolve meaning that after the waiting period mentioned they can only revert or divorce.
The Cow,2,228,"Women who are divorced shall wait, keeping themselves apart, three (monthly) courses. And it is not lawful for them that they should conceal that which Allah hath created in their wombs if they are believers in Allah and the Last Day. And their husbands would do better to take them back in that case if they desire a reconciliation. And they (women) have rights similar to those (of men) over them in kindness, and men are a degree above them. Allah is Mighty, Wise.",Divorced women shall wait by themselves before remarrying for three periods qurū’in is the plural of qar’ of purity or menstruation — these are two different opinions — which begin from the moment of divorce. This stipulation applies to those who have been sexually penetrated but not to those otherwise on account of His saying there shall be no waiting period for you to reckon against them Q. 3349. The waiting period for immature or menopausal women is three months; pregnant women on the other hand must wait until they give birth as stated in the sūrat al-Talāq Q. 654 while slavegirls must wait two months according to the Sunna. And it is not lawful for them to hide what God has created in their wombs of child or menstruation if they believe in God and the Last Day. Their mates their spouses have a better right to restore them to bring them back even if they refuse in such time that is during the waiting period if they desire to set things right between them and put pressure on the woman to return; the statement is not a condition for the possibility of return but an incitement to set things right in the case of repealed divorce; the term ahaqq ‘better right to’ does not denote any priority since in any case no other person has the right to marry them during their waiting period; women shall have rights due from their spouses similar to those rights due from them with justice as stipulated by the Law in the way of kind conjugality and not being harmed; but their men have a degree above them in rights as in their duty to obey their husbands because of their the husbands’ payment of a dowry and their husbands being the bread-winners; God is Mighty in His Kingdom Wise in what He has ordained for His creatures.
The Cow,2,229,"Divorce must be pronounced twice and then (a woman) must be retained in honour or released in kindness. And it is not lawful for you that ye take from women aught of that which ye have given them; except (in the case) when both fear that they may not be able to keep within the limits (imposed by) Allah. And if ye fear that they may not be able to keep the limits of Allah, in that case it is no sin for either of them if the woman ransom herself. These are the limits (imposed by) Allah. Transgress them not. For whoso transgresseth Allah’s limits: such are wrong-doers.",Divorce that is repudiation of the type that may be revoked is twice; then honourable retention that is to say you are then obliged to revert to them to retain them without harming them; or setting them free kindly. It is not lawful for you O male spouses to take of what you have given them of dowry if you divorce them unless the married couple fear that they may not maintain God’s bounds that is to say that they will not honour the rights God has established for them a variant reading for yakhāfā ‘they dual form fear’ has yukhāfā with the direct object taking the accusative ending; allā yuqīmā is an inclusive substitution for the person governing the verb; both verbs are also read in the second person sc. takhāfā ‘you fear’ tuqīmā ‘you maintain’. If you fear they may not maintain God’s bounds neither of them would be at fault if she were to ransom herself of some money so that he should divorce her. In other words in this instance there is no culpability either for the man should he take of the dowry or for the woman should she offer of it. Those prescriptions mentioned are God’s bounds; do not transgress them. Whoever transgresses God’s bounds — those are the evildoers.
The Cow,2,230,"And if he hath divorced her (the third time), then she is not lawful unto him thereafter until she hath wedded another husband. Then if he (the other husband) divorce her it is no sin for both of them that they come together again if they consider that they are able to observe the limits of Allah. These are the limits of Allah. He manifesteth them for people who have knowledge.",If he the husband divorces her after the two utterances of divorce; she shall not be lawful to him after that after the third utterance of divorce until she marries another husband who has sexual intercourse with her as reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim. If he the second husband divorces her then neither of them would be at fault that is the woman and her first husband to return to each other in wedlock after the completion of the waiting period if they think that they will maintain God’s bounds. Those matters mentioned are God’s bounds which He makes clear to a people who have knowledge a people who reflect.
The Cow,2,231,"When ye have divorced women, and they have reached their term, then retain them in kindness or release them in kindness. Retain them not to their hurt so that ye transgress (the limits). He who doeth that hath wronged his soul. Make not the revelations of Allah a laughing-stock (by your behaviour), but remember Allah’s grace upon you and that which He hath revealed unto you of the Scripture and of wisdom, whereby He doth exhort you. Observe your duty to Allah and know that Allah is Aware of all things.",When you divorce women and they have very nearly reached the end of their term then retain them by returning to them honourably not harming them or set them free honourably or leave them until their term is completed; do not retain them when reverting in harm dirāran is an object denoting reason to transgress that is so as to force them to redemption or to repudiate them or confine them indoors for a long time; whoever does that has wronged his soul by exposing it to God’s chastisement; take not God’s verses in mockery in jest by contravening them and remember God’s grace upon you that is Islam and the Book the Qur’ān and the wisdom the rulings contained therein He has revealed to you to exhort you therewith so that you should give thanks by acting in accordance with it; and fear God and know that God has knowledge of all things and nothing can be hidden from Him.
The Cow,2,232,"And when ye have divorced women and they reach their term, place not difficulties in the way of their marrying their husbands if it is agreed between them in kindness. This is an admonition for him among you who believeth in Allah and the Last Day. That is more virtuous for you, and cleaner. Allah knoweth; ye know not.",When you divorce women and they have reached completed their term of waiting do not debar them — addressing the guardians here — from marrying their divorced husbands when they the male spouses and their women have agreed together honourably in accordance with the Law. The occasion for the revelation of this verse was Ma‘qil b. Yasār’s sister was divorced by her husband who then wanted to restore her but Ma‘qil refused as reported by al-Hākim. That the prohibition against debarring is an admonition for whoever of you believe in God and the Last Day because it is for the benefit of such a person; that refraining from debarring is purer for you better and cleaner for you and for them bearing in mind the suspicion that can be aroused by the couple on account of prior intimacy. God knows what is in your interest and you know not any of this so follow His commands.
The Cow,2,233,"Mothers shall suckle their children for two whole years; (that is) for those who wish to complete the suckling. The duty of feeding and clothing nursing mothers in a seemly manner is upon the father of the child. No-one should be charged beyond his capacity. A mother should not be made to suffer because of her child, nor should he to whom the child is born (be made to suffer) because of his child. And on the (father’s) heir is incumbent the like of that (which was incumbent on the father). If they desire to wean the child by mutual consent and (after) consultation, it is no sin for them; and if ye wish to give your children out to nurse, it is no sin for you, provide that ye pay what is due from you in kindness. Observe your duty to Allah, and know that Allah is Seer of what ye do.",Mothers shall suckle their children for two full years kāmilayn ‘two full ones’ is an adjective for emphasis; this is for such as desire to fulfil the suckling and this is the maximum length of time. It is for the father to provide food for them the mothers and clothe them during the suckling if they be divorced honourably to the best of his ability. No soul is charged save to its capacity its ability; a mother shall not be harmed by her child that is on account of the child by being forced to suckle it if she does not want to; neither should a father be harmed by his child that is on account of it by being charged with more than he is able to bear. The mention of both parents here in relation to the child is intended to show sympathy for both. The heir the one inheriting from his father that is the young man who is the trustee of his father’s property has a similar duty to that of the father in terms of providing sustenance and clothing for the other parent. But if the two parents desire by mutual consent agreement and consultation so that the child’s best interests are clear to wean that is to effect ablactation before the completion of the two-year period then they would not be at fault in this matter. And if you addressing the parents desire to seek nursing from other than the mothers for your children you would not be at fault in this respect provided you hand over to them what you have given what you intend to give them in the way of wages honourably in kindness and good nature; and fear God and know that God sees what you do and that nothing of it can be hidden from Him.
The Cow,2,234,"Such of you as die and leave behind them wives, they (the wives) shall wait, keeping themselves apart, four months and ten days. And when they reach the term (prescribed for them) then there is no sin for you in aught that they may do with themselves in decency. Allah is informed of what ye do.",And those of you who pass away die leaving behind wives they shall wait by themselves after their death refraining from marriage for four months and ten nights this applies to women who are not pregnant. The waiting period in the case of pregnant women is for them to give birth — as stated by a verse in sūrat al-Talāq Q. 654. The slavegirl must wait for half this period of four months according to the Sunna; when they have reached completed their term of waiting then you would not be at fault O guardians regarding what they may do with themselves in the way of adorning themselves and offering themselves before suitors honourably in accordance with the Law; God is aware of what you do both secretly and openly.
The Cow,2,235,"There is no sin for you in that which ye proclaim or hide in your minds concerning your troth with women. Allah knoweth that ye will remember them. But plight not your troth with women except by uttering a recognised form of words. And do not consummate the marriage until (the term) prescribed is run. Know that Allah knoweth what is in your minds, so beware of Him; and know that Allah is Forgiving, Clement.",You would not be at fault regarding the proposal with the intention of marriage you present offer or hide in your hearts during the waiting period to women whose spouses have died such as men saying ‘How beautiful you are!’ or ‘Who could find one like you?’ or ‘How many a man must desire you!’. God knows that you will be mindful of them in proposing to them impatiently and so He has permitted you to make such offers; but do not make arrangements of marriage with them secretly unless you speak honourable words such as are acknowledged by the Law in other words such as proposals that which is permitted to you. And do not resolve on the knot the consummation of marriage until that which is written the period prescribed has reached its term and has been completed; and know that God knows what is in your souls of resolve or otherwise; so be fearful of Him that He should chastise you if you have made such resolve; and know that God is Forgiving toward him who is fearful of Him Forbearing in delaying the chastisement of the one deserving it.

(This is) a bounden duty for those who do good.",You would not be at fault if you divorce women while you have not touched them tamassūhunna also read tumāssūhunna that is while you have not had sexual intercourse with them nor appointed any obligation dowry for them the particle mā ‘while’ relates to the verbal action and is also adverbial that is to say there are no sinful consequences for divorcing them if you have not copulated with them or assigned them a dowry so divorce them; yet make provision of comforts for them honourably that is in accordance with the Law bi’l-ma‘rūf ‘honourably’ is an adjectival qualification of matā‘an ‘comforts’ giving them what they can enjoy the one of ample means the affluent among you according to his means and the needy man of restricted income according to his means — an obligation haqqan ‘obligation’ is either a second qualifier of matā‘an ‘comforts’ or an emphatic verbal noun on the virtuous the obedient ones.
The Cow,2,237,"If ye divorce them before ye have touched them and ye have appointed unto them a portion, then (pay the) half of that which ye appointed, unless they (the women) agree to forgo it, or he agreeth to forgo it in whose hand is the marriage tie. To forgo is nearer to piety. And forget not kindness among yourselves. Allah is Seer of what ye do.",And if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have already appointed for them an obligation then one-half of what you have appointed must be given to them and the other half returns to you; unless it be that they the women make remission and forgo it or he makes remission by leaving her the entire amount the one in whose hand is the knot of marriage the husband to be or as Ibn ‘Abbās is reported to have said ‘The legal guardian where the female is a minor’; in which case nobody would be at fault; yet that you should remit wa-an ta‘fū is the subject is nearer to piety aqrabu li’l-taqwā is its predicate. Forget not kindness between you that is to be bountiful towards one another; surely God sees what you do and will requite you accordingly.
The Cow,2,238,"Be guardians of your prayers, and of the midmost prayer, and stand up with devotion to Allah.",Maintain the five prayers by performing them at their appointed times and the middle prayer either that of the afternoon or the morning or the midday or another prayer there are many opinions on this matter; God has singled it out for mention because of its merit; and stand in prayer submissive to God li Lllāhi qānitīn some have said that this means ‘obedience’ on account of the Prophet s saying ‘Wherever the expression qunūt ‘submission’ appears in the Qur’ān it denotes obedience’ as reported by Ahmad b. Hanbal and others; it is also said to mean ‘in silence’ sākitīn on the basis of a hadīth of Zayd b. Arqam in which he said ‘We used to speak to each other sometimes during prayer but when this was revealed we were commanded to be silent and were forbidden to talk’ as reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim.

In other words in whichever way you can facing the direction of the qibla or otherwise making the gestures of genuflexion and prostration; but when you are secure from any fear then remember God by performing prayer as He taught you what you knew not before He taught you its obligations and its proper ways the particle kāf of ka-mā ‘as’ has the same meaning as mithl ‘like’ while the mā is related to the verbal action or is relative.
The Cow,2,240,"(In the case of) those of you who are about to die and leave behind them wives, they should bequeath unto their wives a provision for the year without turning them out, but if they go out (of their own accord) there is no sin for you in that which they do of themselves within their rights. Allah is Mighty, Wise.",And those of you who die leaving wives let them make testament wasiyyatan or wasiyyatun for their wives as an obligation and give them provision what they can enjoy of property and clothes for until the completion of a year matā‘an ilā l-hawl ‘provision for a year’ is a circumstantial qualifier that is without expelling them from their habitations; but if they go forth of their own accord you would not be at fault you the guardians of the dead one regarding what they may do with themselves honourably in accordance with the Law such as adorning themselves or abandoning the mourning or that you should cut off their expenditure; God is Mighty in His Kingdom Wise in His actions. The testament mentioned here was abrogated by the ‘inheritance’ verse Q. 412 and the waiting of one year without expulsion was abrogated by the previous verse four months and ten Q. 2234 which was revealed later. In the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī may God have mercy on him the habitation remains hers.
The Cow,2,241,For divorced women a provision in kindness: a duty for those who ward off (evil).,There shall be provision for divorced women which they are given honourably as is feasible — an obligation haqqan ‘obligation’ is in the accusative because it is governed by an implied verb on those who fear God may He be exalted. He has repeated the phrase in order to include the woman that has been touched sexually since the previous verse addresses a different issue.
The Cow,2,242,Thus Allah expoundeth unto you His revelations so that ye may understand.,So in the same way that He has explained to you what has been mentioned God makes clear His signs for you so that you might understand reflect.
The Cow,2,243,"Bethink thee (O Muhammad) of those of old, who went forth from their habitations in their thousands, fearing death, and Allah said unto them: Die; and then He brought them back to life. Lo! Allah is a Lord of Kindness to mankind, but most of mankind give not thanks.",Have you not seen an interrogative to provoke amazement and a longing to hear what will follow that is ‘Has your knowledge not attained’ those thousands four eight ten thirty forty or seventy thousand who went forth from their habitations fearful of death? hadhara’l-mawt an object denoting reason. These were a people from among the Children of Israel who fled their homeland after it was afflicted with plague. God said to them ‘Die!’ and they did. Then He gave them life after eight days or more as a result of the supplication of their prophet Ezekiel Hizqīl and they lived on for a while with the effects of death still upon them such that when they wore garments these turned into shrouds for the deceased; and this phenomenon remained with their descendants. Truly God is bounteous to people such as when He gave life back to those just mentioned but most people that is disbelievers are not thankful. The purpose of mentioning the story of these people is to encourage believers to fight in the way of God which is why the following statement is supplemented to it
The Cow,2,244,"Fight in the way of Allah, and know that Allah is Hearer, Knower.",So fight in God’s way in order to elevate His religion and know that God is Hearing of your sayings Knowing of your affairs and He will requite you accordingly.
The Cow,2,245,"Who is it that will lend unto Allah a goodly loan, so that He may give it increase manifold ? Allah straiteneth and enlargeth. Unto Him ye will return.",Who is he that will lend God a loan by expending his property in the way of God that is good by expending it for the sake of God Mighty and Majestic out of pureness of heart and He will multiply yudā‘if also read yuda‘‘if it for him manifold? up to ten or seven hundred times or more as will be mentioned soon. God straitens sustenance for whomever He wills in order to try him and enlarges it in abundance for whomever He wills in order to test him; and to Him you shall be returned in the Hereafter through the Resurrection where He will requite you for your deeds.
The Cow,2,246,"Bethink thee of the leaders of the Children of Israel after Moses, how they said unto a prophet whom they had: Set up for us a king and we will fight in Allah’s way. He said: Would ye then refrain from fighting if fighting were prescribed for you ? They said: Why should we not fight in Allah’s way when we have been driven from our dwellings with our children ? Yet, when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned away, all save a few of them. Allah is aware of evil-doers.",Have you not seen the story and the tale of the council an assembly of the Children of Israel after the death of Moses when they said to a prophet of theirs namely Samuel ‘Send establish for us a king to unite us and to whom we can refer matters and we will fight with him in God’s way’. He the prophet said to them ‘Might it be that ‘asaytum or ‘asītum if fighting is prescribed for you you will not fight? allā tuqātilū is the predicate of ‘asā ‘might it be’; the interrogative is intended to confirm the expectation that follows sc. that they will not fight. They said ‘Why should we not fight in God’s way when we have been expelled from our habitations and our children?’ as a result of these latter being taken captive or killed that which they suffered at the hands of Goliath and his men. The meaning is ‘There is nothing to stop us fighting provided the requirement we demanded is forthcoming’. God exalted be He says Yet when fighting was prescribed for them they turned their backs from fighting in cowardice except a few of them the ones that crossed the river with Saul Tālūt as will be mentioned; and God has knowledge of the evildoers and will requite them accordingly. The prophet then asked his Lord to send forth a king and God responded by sending forth Saul.
The Cow,2,247,"Their Prophet said unto them: Lo! Allah hath raised up Saul to be a king for you. They said: How can he have kingdom over us when we are more deserving of the kingdom than he is, since he hath not been given wealth enough ? He said: Lo! Allah hath chosen him above you, and hath increased him abundantly in wisdom and stature. Allah bestoweth His Sovereignty on whom He will. Allah is All-Embracing, All-Knowing.",Then their prophet said to them ‘Verily God has raised up Saul for you as king’ They said ‘How can he be king over us when we have better right than he to kingship since he is not of the tribe of monarchs or that of prophets; he Saul was a tanner or a shepherd; seeing he has not been given amplitude of wealth?’ which he can use to establish a kingdom. He the prophet said to them ‘God has chosen him over you for kingship and has increased him broadly amply in knowledge and body at that time he was the most knowledgeable and the most handsome of all the Children of Israel and the most perfect of character. God gives the kingship to whom He will in the way He does and there can be no objection; and God is Embracing in His bounty Knowing of those who deserve it.
The Cow,2,248,"And their Prophet said unto them: Lo! the token of his kingdom is that there shall come unto you the ark wherein is peace of reassurance from your Lord, and a remnant of that which the house of Moses and the house of Aaron left behind, the angels bearing it. Lo! herein shall be a token for you if (in truth) ye are believers.",And their prophet said to them after they had demanded a sign of his kingship ‘The sign of his kingship is that there will come to you the Ark a chest containing the images of the prophets which God sent down to Adam and which was handed down to them sc. the Israelites until the Amalekites seized it from them in battle. They used to commence fighting invoking it before their enemy and marching behind it as well as experience peacefulness in its presence as God says therein is a Spirit of Peace reassurance for your hearts from your Lord and a remnant of what the folk of Moses and the folk of Aaron left behind which were Moses’s pair of sandals and his staff Aaron’s turban a measure qafīz of the manna that used to come down on them and the pieces of the broken tablets the angels bearing it tahmiluhu l-malā’ikatu the circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb ya’tiyakum ‘there will come to’. Surely in that shall be a sign for you of his kingship if you are believers’. The angels bore it between the earth and the sky while they gazed at it until finally they placed it before Saul. They then acknowledged his kingship and hastened to enlist in the holy struggle and he chose seventy thousand of their young men.
The Cow,2,249,"And when Saul set out with the army, he said: Lo! Allah will try you by (the ordeal of) a river. Whosoever therefore drinketh thereof he is not of me, and whosoever tasteth it not he is of me, save him who taketh (thereof) in the hollow of his hand. But they drank thereof, all save a few of them. And after he had crossed (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: We have no power this day against Goliath and his hosts. But those who knew that they would meet Allah exclaimed: How many a little company hath overcome a mighty host by Allah’s leave! Allah is with the steadfast.",And when Saul went forth with the hosts from the Holy House sc. Jerusalem the heat was intense and so they asked him for water; he said ‘God will try test you in order to distinguish the obedient among you from the disobedient with a river between Jordan and Palestine whoever drinks of it of its water is not of me is not of my followers and whoever tastes it not he is of me except for him who scoops up with his hand’ ghurfa or gharfa ‘a scoop’ satisfying himself therewith and not taking more he is also of my followers. But they drank of it when they reached it and saw that it was abundant except a few of them who restricted themselves to a scoop it is reported that one scoop was enough for each man and his horse and they numbered over three hundred; and when he crossed it with those who believed the ones who confined themselves to the one scoop they the ones that drank profusely said ‘We have no power today against Goliath and his troops’ that is no power to fight them and they were cowardly and did not cross it. Those who thought with certainty that they would meet God at the Resurrection and these were the ones that crossed it said ‘How often kam ‘how’ functions as a predicate meaning kathīr ‘many’ a little company group of men has overcome a numerous one by God’s leave by His will; and God is with the patient’ providing them with help and assistance.
The Cow,2,250,"And when they went into the field against Goliath and his hosts they said: Our Lord! Bestow on us endurance, make our foothold sure, and give us help against the disbelieving folk.",So when they went forth against Goliath and his troops facing them in military columns they said ‘Our Lord pour out upon us patience and make firm our feet by strengthening our hearts for this struggle and grant us victory over the disbelieving folk!’
The Cow,2,251,"So they routed them by Allah’s leave and David slew Goliath; and Allah gave him the kingdom and wisdom, and taught him of that which He willeth. And if Allah had not repelled some men by others the earth would have been corrupted. But Allah is a Lord of Kindness to (His) creatures.",And they routed they broke them by the leave of God by His will and David who was among the ranks of Saul’s army slew Goliath; and God gave him David the kingship over the Children of Israel and Wisdom prophethood after the death of Samuel and Saul and the combination of kingship and prophethood had never come to anyone before him; and He taught him such as He willed of the manufacture of mail-coats and the speech of birds. Had God not repelled people some ba‘dahum ‘some’ substitutes for saying ba‘dan min al-nās ‘some people’ by means of others the earth would have surely been corrupted with idolaters defeating and slaying Muslims and mosques being destroyed; but God is bounteous to all worlds by repelling some by means of others.
The Cow,2,252,"These are the portents of Allah which We recite unto thee (Muhammad) with truth, and lo! thou art of the number of (Our) messengers;",These verses are the verses of God We recite to you O Muhammad (s) as narration in truth and assuredly you are one of the Messengers of God the emphasis is made here with the particle inna of innaka ‘surely you are’ with the remainder of the statement being a rebuttal of the disbelievers’ saying ‘You are no Messenger’.
The Cow,2,253,"Of those messengers, some of whom We have caused to excel others, and of whom there are some unto whom Allah spake, while some of them He exalted (above others) in degree; and We gave Jesus, son of Mary, clear proofs (of Allah’s Sovereignty) and We supported him with the holy Spirit. And if Allah had so wiled it, those who followed after them would not have fought one with another after the clear proofs had come unto them. But they differed, some of them believing and some disbelieving. And if Allah had so willed it, they would not have fought one with another; but Allah doeth what He will.",Those tilka is the subject messengers al-rusul is either an adjective or the predicate some We have preferred above others by assigning a particular trait to one not found in the other; some there are to whom God spoke such as Moses and some He raised in rank namely Muhammad (s) on account of his call being to all peoples his being the Seal of the Prophets on account of the superiority of his community to all others the sundry miracles and the many special qualities. And We gave Jesus son of Mary the clear proofs and confirmed him strengthened him with the Holy Spirit namely Gabriel who would accompany him wherever he went. And had God willed that all people be guided those who came after them after the messengers that is their communities would not have fought against one another after the clear proofs had come to them because of their disagreement and their leading one another astray; but they fell into variance as He willed and some of them believed and adhered firmly to his faith and some disbelieved as the Christians did after Jesus al-Masīh and had God willed they would not have fought against one another repeated here for emphasis but God does whatever He desires giving success to whomever He will and disappointment to whomever He will.
The Cow,2,254,"O ye who believe! spend of that wherewith We have provided you ere a day come when there will be no trafficking, nor friendship, nor intercession. The disbelievers, they are the wrong-doers.",O you who believe expend of what We have provided you with what is due of it as alms before there comes a day in which there shall be neither commerce ransom nor friendship that can be of any benefit nor intercession without His permission a variant reading has all three nouns in nominative inflection bay‘un khullatun shafā‘atun as opposed to lā bay‘a lā khullata lā shafā‘ata this is the Day of Resurrection. And the disbelievers those that disbelieve in God or in the obligations He has imposed on them — they are the evildoers for not respecting God’s command.
The Cow,2,255,"Allah! There is no God save Him, the Alive, the Eternal. Neither slumber nor sleep overtaketh Him. Unto Him belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. Who is he that intercedeth with Him save by His leave ? He knoweth that which is in front of them and that which is behind them, while they encompass nothing of His knowledge save what He will. His throne includeth the heavens and the earth, and He is never weary of preserving them. He is the Sublime, the Tremendous.",God there is no god that is there is none worthy of being worshipped in all existence except Him the Living the Everlasting the Eternal Sustainer the One constantly engaged in the management of His creation. Slumber does not seize Him neither sleep; to Him belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth as possessions creatures and servants; who is there that is to say none is there that shall intercede with Him save by His leave? in this for him. He knows what lies before them that is creation and what is after them of the affairs of this world and the Hereafter; and they encompass nothing of His knowledge that is they know nothing of what He knows save such as He wills to inform of it by way of His messengers. His throne subsumes the heavens and the earth it is said that His knowledge encompasses them both; it is also said that the kursī ‘throne’ itself subsumes them on account of its vastness as in the hadīth ‘The seven heavens compared to the kursī are like seven silver coins lying in a metal shield of armour’; the preserving of them the heavens and the earth wearies Him not does not burden Him; He is the Sublime above His creation by virtue of His subjugation of them the Tremendous the Great.
The Cow,2,256,"There is no compulsion in religion. The right direction is henceforth distinct from error. And he who rejecteth false deities and believeth in Allah hath grasped a firm handhold which will never break. Allah is Hearer, Knower.",There is no compulsion in entering into religion. Rectitude has become clear from error that is say through clear proofs it has become manifest that faith is rectitude and disbelief is error this was revealed concerning the Ansār of Medina who tried to compel their sons to enter into Islam; so whoever disbelieves in the false deity namely Satan or idols tāghūt ‘false deity’ is used in a singular and plural sense and believes in God has laid hold of the most firm handle the tight knot unbreaking that cannot be severed; God is Hearing of what is said Knowing of what is done.
The Cow,2,257,"Allah is the Protecting Guardian of those who believe. He bringeth them out of darkness into light. As for those who disbelieve, their patrons are false deities. They bring them out of light into darkness. Such are rightful owners of the Fire. They will abide therein.",God is the Protector helper of the believers; He brings them forth from the shadows of unbelief into the light of faith. And the disbelievers — their protectors are false deities that bring them forth from the light into the shadows the repetition of ‘bringing forth from’ here is either to be taken as a reflection of His previous words “He brings them forth from the shadows” or as a reference to all those Jews who believed in the Prophet before he was sent but then rejected him those are the inhabitants of the Fire therein they shall abide.
The Cow,2,258,"Bethink thee of him who had an argument with Abraham about his Lord, because Allah had given him the kingdom; how, when Abraham said: My Lord is He Who giveth life and causeth death, he answered: I give life and cause death. Abraham said: Lo! Allah causeth the sun to rise in the East, so do thou cause it to come up from the West. Thus was the disbeliever abashed. And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.",Have you not seen him who disputed with Abraham concerning his Lord because of the fact that God had given him the kingship? that is his arrogance towards this very grace of God this was Nimrod Nimrūd. When idh is a substitution for hājja ‘disputed’ Abraham in response to the other’s question ‘Who is this Lord of yours to whom you are calling us?’ said ‘My Lord is He who gives life and makes to die’ the One that creates life and death in bodies; he Nimrod said ‘I give life by sparing and make to die’ by killing. He then had two men brought before him killed one and spared the other. When Abraham realised that this man was a fool Abraham resorting to a more sophisticated argument said ‘God brings the sun from the east; so bring you it from the west.’ Then the disbeliever was confused perplexed and amazed; and God guides not the folk who do evil disbelieving to the art of argument.
The Cow,2,259,"Or (bethink thee of) the like of him who, passing by a township which had fallen into utter ruin, exclaimed: How shall Allah give this township life after its death ? And Allah made him die a hundred years, then brought him back to life. He said: How long hast thou tarried ? (The man) said: I have tarried a day or part of a day. (He) said: Nay, but thou hast tarried for a hundred years. Just look at thy food and drink which have not rotted! Look at thine ass! And, that We may make thee a token unto mankind, look at the bones, how We adjust them and then cover them with flesh! And when (the matter) became clear unto him, he said: I know now that Allah is Able to do all things.",Or did you see such as he Ezra ‘Uzayr who the kāf of ka’lladhī ‘such as he who’ is extra passed by a city namely the Holy House sc. Jerusalem riding on an ass and carrying with him a basket of figs and a cup of juice a city that was fallen down collapsed upon its turrets its roof tops after Nebuchadnezzar had destroyed it; he said ‘How annā means kayfa ‘how’ shall God give life to this now that it is dead?’ challenging the power of the exalted One so God made him die and remain dead for a hundred years then he raised him up brought him back to life to show him how this could be done; He God said ‘How long have you tarried?’ been here?; he said ‘I have tarried a day or part of a day’ because he fell asleep before noon and was made dead and then brought back to life again at sunset and thus he thought it was a day’s sleep; He said ‘Nay; you have tarried a hundred years. Look at your food the figs and drink the cup of juice it has not spoiled despite the length of time the final hā’ of yatasannah ‘to spoil’ is said to belong to the original root s-n-h; but it is also said to be silent in which case the root would be s-n-y; a variant reading omits the final hā’; and look at your ass how it is and he saw that it had died and all that remained were its withered white bones. We did this so that you would know and so that We would make you a sign of the truth of the Resurrection for the people. And look at the bones of the ass how We shall set them up how We shall raise them back to life nunshiruhā or nanshiruhā derived from the two expressions nashara and anshara; a variant reading has nunshizuhā meaning ‘How We shall move it and make it stand’; and then clothe them with flesh’ and when he looked at it he saw that the bones had been reconstituted and clothed with flesh and that the Spirit had been breathed into it making it bray. So when it was made clear to him as a result of witnessing it he said ‘I know a variant reading for a‘lam ‘I know’ has the imperative i‘lam ‘know!’ thus making it a command from God with the knowledge of direct vision that God has power over all things’.
The Cow,2,260,"And when Abraham said (unto his Lord): My Lord! Show me how Thou givest life to the dead, He said: Dost thou not believe ? Abraham said: Yea, but (I ask) in order that my heart may be at ease. (His Lord) said: Take four of the birds and cause them to incline unto thee, then place a part of them on each hill, then call them, they will come to thee in haste, and know that Allah is Mighty, Wise.",And mention when Abraham said ‘My Lord show me how You give life to the dead’ He God exalted be He said to him ‘Why do you not believe?’ in My power to revive; God asks him this even though He knows of his belief in this power as a response to his request and so that the ones listening will know the purpose of the request; ‘Yes’ I do believe he said ‘but I ask You so that my heart may be re-assured’ so that it may be at peace through direct vision in addition to that certainty which is sought through logical reasoning. Said He ‘Take four birds and twist them to you sirhunna or surhunna turn them towards you cut them up and mix together their flesh and feathers then set a part of them on every hill in the land around you then summon them to you and they will come to you in haste. And know that God is Mighty that nothing is beyond Him Wise’ in His actions. Abraham took a peacock an eagle a raven and a cock and did with them as has been mentioned but kept their heads with him. He called them and all the parts began to fly back together combining until they were whole and returning to their heads.
The Cow,2,261,"The likeness of those who spend their wealth in Allah’s way is as the likeness of a grain which groweth seven ears, in every ear a hundred grains. Allah giveth increase manifold to whom He will. Allah is All- Embracing, All-Knowing.",The likeness of the quality of the expenditure of those who expend their wealth in the way of God that is in obedience of Him is as the likeness of a grain of corn that sprouts seven ears in every ear a hundred grains likewise what they expend will be multiplied seven hundred times; so God multiplies even more than this for whom He will; God is Embracing in His bounty Knowing those who deserve such multiplications.
The Cow,2,262,"Those who spend their wealth for the cause of Allah and afterward make not reproach and injury to follow that which they have spent; their reward is with their Lord, and there shall no fear come upon them, neither shall they grieve.",Those who expend their wealth in the way of God then do not follow up their expenditure with reminder of their generosity of the one on whom they expended for example by saying ‘I was good to him and restored his affairs’; and injury to that person by mentioning this to people whom he would prefer not to know about it; their wage the reward for their expenditure is with their Lord and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter.
The Cow,2,263,"A kind word with forgiveness is better than almsgiving followed by injury. Allah is Absolute, Clement.",Honourable words kind talk and a generous reply to the beggar and forgiveness towards him for his persistence are better than a voluntary almsgiving followed by injury through reproach and deriding him for his begging; and God is Independent of the voluntary almsgiving of His servants Forbearing in His delaying the punishment of the reproachful and injurious one.
The Cow,2,264,"O ye who believe! Render not vain your almsgiving by reproach and injury, like him who spendeth his wealth only to be seen of men and believeth not in Allah and the Last Day. His likeness is as the likeness of a rock whereon is dust of earth; a rainstorm smiteth it, leaving it smooth and bare. They have no control of aught of that which they have gained. Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk.",O you who believe annul not the rewards of your voluntary almsgivings with reproach and injury as in the manner of the annulment of the expenditure of one who expends of his substance to show off to men and believes not in God and the Last Day this is the hypocrite. The likeness of him is as the likeness of a smooth rock on which is soil and a torrent of intense rain smites it and leaves it barren and smooth with nothing on it. They have no power lā yaqdirūna is a resumption of the statement about the likeness of the one that expends for show; the person becomes plural on account of the potential plural implication of alladhī ‘the one who’ over anything that they have earned that they did in other words they find no reward for it in the Hereafter just as one finds nothing of the dust that was on the surface of the smooth rock after the rain has washed it away. God guides not the disbelieving folk.
The Cow,2,265,"And the likeness of those who spend their wealth in search of Allah’s pleasure, and for the strengthening of their souls, is as the likeness of a garden on a height. The rainstorm smiteth it and it bringeth forth its fruit twofold. And if the rainstorm smite it not, then the shower. Allah is Seer of what ye do.",But the likeness of the expenditure of those who expend their wealth seeking God’s good pleasure and to confirm themselves that is to realise the reward thereof in contrast to the hypocrites who do not hope for it since they do not believe in it is as the likeness of a garden an orchard upon a hill read rabwa or rubwa a high ground; a torrent smites it and it yields gives forth its produce read ukulahā or uklahā its fruits twofold twice the fruits of another garden; if no torrent smites it then dew tall a light drizzle which falls on it and suffices it on account of its altitude. In other words it grows and bears fruit regardless of how much rain falls; likewise are the expenditures of those mentioned they will increase with God regardless of how much they were; and God sees what you do and He will requite you for it.
The Cow,2,266,"Would any of you like to have a garden of palm-trees and vines, with rivers flowing underneath it, with all kinds of fruit for him therein; and old age hath stricken him and he hath feeble offspring; and a fiery whirlwind striketh it and it is (all) consumed by fire. Thus Allah maketh plain His revelations unto you, in order that ye may give thought.",Would any of you wish to have a garden an orchard of date-palms and vines with rivers flowing beneath it for him there is in it all manner of fruit then old age smites him and makes him too weak to profit from it and he has seed but they are weak young children who cannot manage it; then a whirlwind i‘sār are violent winds with fire smites it and it is consumed? so that he loses what he is most in need of and now he and his children have become incapacitated confused without any resources. This is a similitude of how the expenditure of the one expending for show or the one who reproaches after having expended vanishes and how it is of no avail when he will be most in need of it in the Hereafter the interrogative a-yawaddu ‘would any wish’ is intended as a denial. According to Ibn ‘Abbās this is the person who performs deeds of obedience but when Satan comes to him he begins to work disobedience until all his good deeds have been consumed. So in the way that He has explained what has been mentioned God makes clear the signs to you so that you might reflect and take heed.
The Cow,2,267,"O ye who believe! Spend of the good things which ye have earned, and of that which We bring forth from the earth for you, and seek not the bad (with intent) to spend thereof (in charity) when ye would not take it for yourselves save with disdain; and know that Allah is Absolute, Owner of Praise.",O you who believe expend of that is to say purify the good things you have earned of property and the good things of what We have produced for you from the earth of grains and fruits and seek not lā tayammamū means lā taqsudū the corrupt the vile of it the above-mentioned for your expending it as alms tunfiqūna ‘you expend’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the verb tayammamū ‘seek’; for you would never take it the vile part yourselves if you were given it as something due to you; without closing your eyes to it by being careless and mindless so how do you expect to give what is due to God from this?; and know that God is Independent of your expenditures Laudable praised in every situation.
The Cow,2,268,"The devil promiseth you destitution and enjoineth on you lewdness. But Allah promiseth you forgiveness from Himself with bounty. Allah is All- Embracing, All-knowing.",Satan promises you poverty by making you fear loss when you make a voluntary almsgiving and so you withhold it and enjoins you to indecency niggardliness and the impeding of almsgiving; but God promises you in return for your expenditure His pardon for your sins and His bounty as sustenance from Him; and God is Embracing in His bounty Knowing the one who expends.
The Cow,2,269,"He giveth wisdom unto whom He will, and he unto whom wisdom is given, he truly hath received abundant good. But none remember except men of understanding.",He gives wisdom that is the profitable knowledge that leads to righteous action to whomever He will and he who is given wisdom has been given much good because he will end up in perpetual bliss; yet none remembers the tā’ of yadhdhakkar has been assimilated with the dhāl that is to say none is admonished but the people of pith possessors of intellects.
The Cow,2,270,"Whatever alms ye spend or vow ye vow, lo! Allah knoweth it. Wrong- doers have no helpers.",And whatever expenditure you expend be it as alms or a voluntary almsgiving and whatever vow you make and fulfil surely God knows it and will requite you for it. For the evildoers who prevent almsgiving and vows or expend other than the way they should in disobedience to God they have no helpers to protect them from His chastisement.
The Cow,2,271,"If ye publish your almsgiving, it is well, but if ye hide it and give it to the poor, it will be better for you, and will atone for some of your ill-deeds. Allah is Informed of what ye do.",If you proclaim make manifest your voluntary almsgivings that is your supererogatory deeds it is a fine thing to show them; but if you conceal them and give them to the poor that is even better for you than making them manifest or giving it to the rich. As regards the obligatory almsgiving it is better to make it manifest so that it serves as an example and so that one is not accused falsely of not giving; as regards giving it to the poor this is obligatory; and it will absolve you of some of your evil deeds read yukaffir ‘it will absolve’ or nukaffir ‘We will absolve’ either in apocopated form with no final vowel yukaffir nukaffir being a supplement to the locus of fa-huwa ‘that is’ or with nominative inflection yukaffiru nukaffiru indicating the beginning of a new sentence. God is aware of what you do knowing its inner and outer aspects nothing of it being hidden from Him.
The Cow,2,272,"The guiding of them is not thy duty (O Muhammad), but Allah guideth whom He will. And whatsoever good thing ye spend, it is for yourselves, when ye spend not save in search of Allah’s Countenance; and whatsoever good thing ye spend, it will be repaid to you in full, and ye will not be wronged.",When the Prophet s was prohibited from giving voluntary alms to idolaters as an incentive for them to embrace Islam the following was revealed You are not responsible for guiding them that is to say for people that they should embrace Islam you are responsible only for conveying the Message to them; but God guides with His guidance whomever He will to embrace Islam. And whatever good property you expend is for yourselves since the reward is for you; for then you are expending desiring only God’s Face this clause is the predicate denoting a prohibition that is to say His reward and not any other transient object of this world and whatever good you expend its requital shall be repaid to you in full and you will not be wronged you will not suffer any diminishment of it both of the last two sentences emphasise the first one.
The Cow,2,273,"(Alms are) for the poor who are straitened for the cause of Allah, who cannot travel in the land (for trade). The unthinking man accounteth them wealthy because of their restraint. Thou shalt know them by their mark: They do not beg of men with importunity. And whatsoever good thing ye spend, lo! Allah knoweth it.",For the poor this is the predicate of the missing subject al-sadaqāt ‘voluntary almsgiving’ who are constrained in the way of God those who have confined themselves in preparation for the struggle this was revealed concerning the people of Suffa consisting in some four hundred of the Emigrants muhājirūn set apart from the other Muslims for the study of the Qur’ān and to take part in raids; and they are unable to journey darban means safaran in the land to engage in commerce and earn their living since they are fully engaged in the struggle; the ignorant man supposes them on account of the way they behave rich because of their abstinence that is their refraining from asking for things; but you the one being addressed shall know them by their mark by the signs of their humility and exertion; they do not beg of men and make urgent demands importunately that is to say they do not beg in the first place so there is no question of persistence. And whatever good you expend surely God has knowledge of it and will requite it accordingly.
The Cow,2,274,"Those who spend their wealth by night and day, by stealth and openly, verily their reward is with their Lord, and their shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve.",Those who expend their wealth night and day secretly and openly their wage awaits them with their Lord and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve.
The Cow,2,275,"Those who swallow usury cannot rise up save as he ariseth whom the devil hath prostrated by (his) touch. That is because they say: Trade is just like usury; whereas Allah permitteth trading and forbiddeth usury. He unto whom an admonition from his Lord cometh, and (he) refraineth (in obedience thereto), he shall keep (the profits of) that which is past, and his affair (henceforth) is with Allah. As for him who returneth (to usury) - Such are rightful owners of the Fire. They will abide therein.",Those who devour that is those who seize by way of usury which is an excess levied in transactions of money or foodstuffs either on their value or on credit shall not rise again from their graves except rising as one whom Satan has made prostrate demented from touch through madness min al-mass ‘from touch’ is semantically connected to yaqūmūna ‘they rise’; that which befalls them is because of the fact that they say ‘Trade is like usury’ in terms of permissibility this statement is a type of reversed simile used for intensity sc. ‘usury is like trade’ is the expected word order. God responds to them saying that God has permitted trade and forbidden usury. Whoever receives an admonition from his Lord and desists from devouring it he shall have his past gains those made before the prohibition and which cannot be reclaimed from him and his affair with regard to pardoning him is committed to God; but whoever reverts to devouring it treating it like trade in terms of lawfulness — those are the inhabitants of the Fire abiding therein.
The Cow,2,276,Allah hath blighted usury and made almsgiving fruitful. Allah loveth not the impious and guilty.,God effaces usury diminishing it and eliminating any blessing in it but He augments voluntary almsgivings with interest increasing them making them grow and multiplying their reward. God loves not that is to say He will requite any guilty profligate devouring it ingrate who deems usury licit.
The Cow,2,277,"Lo! those who believe and do good works and establish worship and pay the poor-due, their reward is with their Lord and there shall no fear come upon them neither shall they grieve.",Those who believe and perform righteous deeds and establish the prayer and pay the alms — their wage awaits them with their Lord and no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve.
The Cow,2,278,"O ye who believe! Observe your duty to Allah, and give up what remaineth (due to you) from usury, if ye are (in truth) believers.",O you who believe fear God and give up abandon the usury that is outstanding if you are believers true to your faith since it is expected of the believer that he adhere to God’s command this was revealed when some of the Companions after the prohibition wanted to reclaim some of the usury from before.
The Cow,2,279,"And if ye do not, then be warned of war (against you) from Allah and His messenger. And if ye repent, then ye have your principal (without interest). Wrong not, and ye shall not be wronged.",But if you do not do what you have been commanded then be warned have knowledge of war from God and His Messenger against you herein is a grave threat for them. When it was revealed they said ‘What power can we have in a war against Him!’ Yet if you repent and forgo it you shall have your principal sums the original amounts not being unjust by charging interest and no injustice being done to you by way of any diminution.
The Cow,2,280,"And if the debtor is in straitened circumstances, then (let there be) postponement to (the time of) ease; and that ye remit the debt as almsgiving would be better for you if ye did but know.",And if any man in debt should be in difficulties then let him have respite a postponement till things are easier read maysara or maysura meaning ‘a time of ease’; but that you should give tassaddaqū where the second tā’ of the softened form tatasaddaqū has been assimilated with the sād the one in difficulty a voluntary almsgiving by waiving his debt is better for you did you but know if you know that it is better for you then do it. In a hadīth it is said ‘Whoever gives respite to one in difficulty or waives his debt God will place him under His shade on a day when there shall be no shade except God’s’ as reported by Muslim.
The Cow,2,281,"And guard yourselves against a day in which ye will be brought back to Allah. Then every soul will be paid in full that which it hath earned, and they will not be wronged.",And fear a day wherein you shall be returned to God namely the Day of Resurrection read the passive turja‘ūna meaning ‘you shall be returned’ or the active tarji‘ūna meaning ‘you shall return’ and every soul on that day shall be paid in full the requital of what it has earned what it has done of good or evil; and they shall not be wronged through any loss of a good deed or the incurring of an extra evil deed.
The Cow,2,282,"O ye who believe! When ye contract a debt for a fixed term, record it in writing. Let a scribe record it in writing between you in (terms of) equity. No scribe should refuse to write as Allah hath taught him, so let him write, and let him who incurreth the debt dictate, and let him observe his duty to Allah his Lord, and diminish naught thereof. But if he who oweth the debt is of low understanding, or weak, or unable himself to dictate, then let the guardian of his interests dictate in (terms of) equity. And call to witness, from among your men, two witnesses. And if two men be not (at hand) then a man and two women, of such as ye approve as witnesses, so that if the one erreth (through forgetfulness)the other will remember. And the witnesses must not refuse when they are summoned. Be not averse to writing down (the contract) whether it be small or great, with (record of) the term thereof. That is more equitable in the sight of Allah anfd more sure for testimony, and the best way of avoiding doubt between you; save only in the case when it is actual merchandise which ye transfer among yourselves from hand to hand. In that case it is no sin for you if ye write it not. And have witness when ye sell one to another, and let no harm be done to scribe or witness. If ye do (harm to them) lo! it is a sin in you. Observe your duty to Allah. Allah is teaching you. And Allah is knower of all things.",O you who believe when you contract when you are dealing with a debt such as in prepayment for future delivery of goods or a loan one upon another for a stated a known term write it down as confirmation and security against any dispute; and let a writer write it the contract of debt down between you justly accurately not increasing or decreasing the amount or the terms; and let not any writer refuse to write it down if he is requested for such a task as God has taught him the kāf of ka-mā ‘as’ is semantically connected to the verb ya’ba ‘refuse’ that is just as He has given him the advantage of knowing how to write he should not be niggardly in this respect; so let him write repeated for emphasis and let the debtor dictate to the one writing the contract for he is the one being witnessed and must be fully aware of his obligations; and let him fear God his Lord when dictating and not diminish anything of it of the debt due. And if the debtor be a fool a squanderer or weak not up to dictating on account of old age or immaturity or unable to dictate himself on account of being dumb or not knowing the language and so forth then let his guardian the one in charge of his affairs be it a parent an executor a custodian or an interpreter dictate justly. And summon to bear witness the debt two witnesses men mature Muslim free men; or if the two witnesses be not men then one man and two women to bear witness such witnesses as you approve of on account of their piety and probity; the number of women is because of the fact so that if one of the two women errs forgets the testimony given their lesser astuteness and accuracy; the other the one remembering will remind her read fa-tudhakkira or fa-tudhkira the one that has forgotten — the ‘reminding’ clause is the reason for the choice of two women that is to say so that she may be reminded if she errs or strays into error because this forgetfulness is the cause of it a variant reading for an ‘that’ has the conditional in ‘if’ with the verb inflected as tudhakkiru ‘she will remind’ making it a new sentence the response to which follows; and let the witnesses not refuse whenever the mā of idhā mā ‘whenever’ is extra they are summoned to bear witness and take responsibility for the testimony; and be not disdainful lazy to write it down that which you have witnessed in truth for this frequently occurred be it small or great a little or much with its term that is the date on which it is due ilā ajlihi is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the pronominal suffix hā’ of taktubū-hu ‘you write it down’; that writing down is more equitable more just in God’s sight more upright for testimony that is to say that is more helpful in summoning witness because it contains the reminder; and nearer closer to attaining the desired state that you will not be in doubt with regard to the amount and the due dates; unless it be that there is trade carried out there and then tijāratun hādiratun a variant reading has tijāratan hādiratan in which case the nominal sentence is missing its subject and must be the pronoun for tijāra ‘trade’ that is hiya ‘it fem.
The Cow,2,283,"If ye be on a journey and cannot find a scribe, then a pledge in hand (shall suffice). And if one of you entrusteth to another let him who is trusted deliver up that which is entrusted to him (according to the pact between them) and let him observe his duty to Allah his Lord. Hide not testimony. He who hideth it, verily his heart is sinful. Allah is Aware of what ye do.",And if you are upon a journey travelling and you contract a debt and you do not find a writer then a pledge ruhun or rihān plural of rahn in hand as a guarantee for you. The Sunna clarifies the permissibility of making pledges in towns where writers may be forthcoming; but the stipulation is made in the event of travel because in this case it is more important to have a guarantee; God’s reference to it being ‘in hand’ maqbūda is a condition for the pledge given to be valid and to satisfy the pledgee or his representative. But if one of you the creditor trusts another the debtor over the debt and does not require a pledge let him who is trusted the debtor deliver his trust the debt; and let him fear God his Lord when delivering it. And do not conceal the testimony if you are summoned to give it; whoever conceals it his heart is sinful the heart is mentioned because it is the locus of the testimony and because if it sins there are other sinful consequences and so the person will be punished as though he were a sinner; and God knows what you do nothing of which can be hidden from Him.
The Cow,2,284,"Unto Allah (belongeth) whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth; and whether ye make known what is in your minds or hide it, Allah will bring you to account for it. He will forgive whom He will and He will punish whom He will. Allah is Able to do all things.",To God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Whether you disclose manifest what is in your hearts or hide it of evil and resolve for it God shall take you to account for it informing you of it on the Day of Resurrection. Then He will forgive whom He will to forgive and chastise whom He will to chastise both verbs are apocopated fa-yaghfir ‘he will forgive’ wa-yu‘adhdhib ‘he will chastise’ if taken as the responses to the conditional in tubdū ‘if you proclaim’; but they may also be read with a final nominative inflection yaghfiru yu‘adhdhibu in which case it would constitute a new clause and follow on from an implicit fa-huwa ‘then He’. And God has power over all things including reckoning with you and requiting you.
The Cow,2,285,"The messenger believeth in that which hath been revealed unto him from his Lord and (so do) believers. Each one believeth in Allah and His angels and His scriptures and His messengers - We make no distinction between any of His messengers - and they say: We hear, and we obey. (Grant us) Thy forgiveness, our Lord. Unto Thee is the journeying.",The Messenger Muhammad (s) believes in affirms the truth of what was revealed to him from his Lord namely the Qur’ān and the believers wa’l-mu’minūna is a supplement to al-rasūlu ‘the Messenger’; each one the tanwīn of kullun stands in place of the second noun in an annexation sc. kullu wāhidin believes in God and His angels and in His Books all of them and each of them and His messengers and they say ‘we make no distinction between any of His messengers’ believing in some and disbelieving in others in the manner of the Jews and the Christians. And they say ‘We hear what we have been enjoined to hear and accept and obey; we ask you Your forgiveness our Lord; to You is the homecoming’ that is the return at the Resurrection. When the previous verse was revealed the believers complained of evil whisperings and it grieved them that they should be taken to account according to the principle expressed in it and so the following was revealed
The Cow,2,286,"Allah tasketh not a soul beyond its scope. For it (is only) that which it hath earned, and against it (only) that which it hath deserved. Our Lord! Condemn us not if we forget, or miss the mark! Our Lord! Lay not on us such a burden as thou didst lay on those before us! Our Lord! Impose not on us that which we have not the strength to bear! Pardon us, absolve us and have mercy on us, Thou, our Protector, and give us victory over the disbelieving folk.",God charges no soul save to its capacity that is what it is capable of bearing; for it is what it has merited of good and its reward and against it is what it has earned of evil and its burden no person shall be requited for another’s sin or for what he has not earned even if he was tempted to do it. Say Our Lord take us not to task by way of chastisement if we forget or err by straying from the right path unknowingly — as You used to take to task those before us God has lifted this burden from this community as reported in hadīth. The petition here then is a way of acknowledging God’s favour; our Lord burden us not with a load an affair which we cannot bear such as You did lay upon those before us namely upon the Children of Israel as for example the killing of oneself in repentance the paying of a quarter of one’s property for alms and the severing of the impure part. Our Lord do not burden us beyond what we have the power the strength to bear of obligations and trials; and pardon us effacing our sins and forgive us and have mercy on us with mercy added to Your forgiveness; You are our Patron our Master and the Guardian of our affairs; so grant us assistance against the disbelieving folk by establishing definitive proof for us and victory over them in battle for it is expected of a patron that he assist his clients against their enemies. In a hadīth it is stated that when this verse was revealed and the Prophet s was reciting it after each word it was said to him “Granted”.

The Family of 'Imrân,3,4,"Aforetime, for a guidance to mankind; and hath revealed the Criterion (of right and wrong). Lo! those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah, theirs will be a heavy doom. Allah is Mighty, Able to Requite (the wrong).",before that is to say before revealing it the Qur’ān as guidance hudan a circumstantial qualifier meaning hādiyīn ‘guides from error’ to people to those who followed these two Books He uses the word anzala for the revelation of these two and nazzala for that of the Qur’ān for the latter entails repetition whereas the two Books were revealed in one instance; and He revealed the Criterion al-furqān meaning the Scriptures that discriminate between truth and falsehood. He mentions this Criterion after He has mentioned the three Scriptures so that it encompasses all revealed Scriptures besides these. As for those who disbelieve in God’s signs the Qur’ān or any other revelation for them awaits a terrible chastisement; God is Mighty victorious in His affair so that nothing can prevent Him from effecting His promise and His threat; Lord of Retribution with a severe punishment for those that disobeyed Him the like of which none can do.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,5,Lo! nothing in the earth or in the heavens is hidden from Allah.,Nothing no existent thing whatever is hidden in heaven and earth from God on account of His knowledge of universals and particulars. God specifies them heaven and earth because sensory perception does not go beyond these.

The Family of 'Imrân,3,7,"He it is Who hath revealed unto thee (Muhammad) the Scripture wherein are clear revelations - they are the substance of the Book - and others (which are) allegorical. But those in whose hearts is doubt pursue, forsooth, that which is allegorical seeking (to cause) dissension by seeking to explain it. None knoweth its explanation save Allah. And those who are of sound instruction say: We believe therein; the whole is from our Lord; but only men of understanding really heed.",He it is Who revealed to you the Book wherein are verses that are clear lucid in proof forming the Mother Book the original basis for rulings and others allegorical whose meanings are not known such as the opening verses of some sūras. He God refers to the whole Qur’ān as 1 ‘clear’ muhkam where He says A Book whose verses have been made clear Q. 111 meaning that it contains no imperfections; and as 2 ‘allegorical’ mutashābih where He says A Book consimilar Q. 3923 meaning that its parts resemble each other in terms of beauty and veracity. As for those in whose hearts is deviation inclination away from truth they follow the allegorical part desiring sedition among the ignorant of them throwing them into specious arguments and confusion and desiring its interpretation its explanation and none knows its interpretation its explanation save God Him alone. And those firmly rooted established and capable in knowledge al-rāsikhūna fī’l-‘ilm is the subject the predicate of which is what follows say ‘We believe in it the allegorical part that it is from God and we do not know its meaning; all of the clear and the allegorical is from our Lord’; yet none remembers yadhdhakkar the initial tā’ of yatadhakkar has been assimilated with the dhāl that is none is admonished but people of pith possessors of intellect who when they see those following that allegorical part only also say

The Family of 'Imrân,3,9,Our Lord! Lo! it is Thou Who gatherest mankind together to a Day of which there is no doubt. Lo! Allah faileth not to keep the tryst.,Our Lord You shall gather mankind for a day that is on a day of which there is no doubt no uncertainty that is the Day of Resurrection when You will requite them for their deeds as You had promised; verily God will not fail the tryst His promise of the Upraising there is a shift of address here from the second to the third person and these last words could constitute God’s speech. The purpose of their supplication in this way is to show that their concern is with the matter of the Hereafter and for this reason they ask God for adherence to the path of guidance in order to attain its reward. The two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim reported that ‘Ā’isha may God be pleased with her said ‘The Messenger of God s recited this verse It is He Who revealed to you the Book wherein are verses clear to the end of the verse and said “When you see those pursuing the allegorical parts know that these are the ones God refers to in this verse so beware of them” ’. Al-Tabarānī reported in his al-Kabīr that Abū Mūsā al-Ash‘arī heard the Prophet s say ‘I fear nothing for my community except three faults’ and he mentioned that one of these would be when the Book is opened in front of them and the believer will desire to interpret it and yet none knows its interpretation save God; and those firmly rooted in knowledge say ‘We believe in it all is from our Lord; yet none remembers but people of pith’ Q. 37 end of the hadīth.

And Allah is severe in punishment.",Their way is as the way as the habit of Pharaoh’s folk and the communities of people before them such as ‘Ād and Thamūd who denied Our signs; God seized them He destroyed them for their sins this statement explains the previous one; God is severe in retribution.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,12,"Say (O Muhammad) unto those who disbelieve: Ye shall be overcome and gathered unto Hell, an evil resting-place.",When the Prophet s enjoined the Jews to enter into Islam after his return from Badr they said ‘Do not fool yourself just because you killed a few men of Quraysh inexperienced and knowing nothing about fighting’ whereupon the following was revealed Say O Muhammad (s) to the disbelievers from among the Jews ‘You shall be vanquished sa-tughlabūn or read sa-yughlabūn ‘they shall be vanquished’ in this world through being killed or taken captive and made to pay the jizya which actually took place and mustered read in both ways wa-tuhsharūna ‘you will be mustered’ or wa-yuhsharūna ‘they will be mustered’ in the Hereafter to Hell which you shall enter — an evil cradling!’ an evil resting place.

That which is mentioned is the comfort of the life of this world enjoyed while it lasts but then perishes; but God — with Him is the more excellent abode place of return which is Paradise and for this reason one should desire none other than this abode.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,15,"Say: Shall I inform you of something better than that ?

For those that are fearful of idolatry with their Lord ‘inda rabbihim is the predicate the subject being the following jannātun…’ are Gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding therein decreed for them therein is eternal life when they enter it and spouses purified of menstruation and other impurities and beatitude read ridwān or rudwān meaning ‘much pleasure’ from God; and God is Seer knower of His servants requiting each of them according to his deeds.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,16,Those who say: Our Lord! Lo! we believe. So forgive us our sins and guard us from the punishment of Fire;,Those alladhīna is either an adjectival qualification of or a substitution for the previous alladhīna who say “O Our Lord we believe in You and in Your Prophet; so forgive us our sins and guard us from the chastisement of the Fire”.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,17,"The steadfast, and the truthful, and the obedient, those who spend (and hoard not), those who pray for pardon in the watches of the night.",The patient in obedience and against disobedience al-sābirīna ‘the patient’ is an adjectival qualification of alladhīna ‘those’ truthful in their faith obedient compliant before God expenders of charity imploring God’s pardon by saying ‘Lord forgive us’ at daybreak’ in the last part of the night singled out here for mention because it is the time of unawareness and of the joy of sleep.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,18,"Allah (Himself) is Witness that there is no God save Him. And the angels and the men of learning (too are witness). Maintaining His creation in justice, there is no God save Him the Almighty, the Wise.",God bears witness that is to say He has made it clear to His creation through proofs and signs that there is no god none that is truly worshipped in existence except Him He has borne witness to this and the angels have also borne witness to this by affirming it and those of knowledge from among the prophets and the believers through their conviction and in words; upholding constantly and uniquely maintaining His creations with justice qā’iman ‘upholding’ is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier and is governed by the import of the statement implied to be something like tafarrada ‘He alone is upholding…’; there is no god except Him He has repeated it for emphasis; the Mighty in His Kingdom the Wise in His actions.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,19,"Lo! religion with Allah (is) the Surrender (to His Will and Guidance).

And whoever disbelieves in God’s signs God is swift at reckoning that is at requiting him.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,20,"And if they argue with thee, (O Muhammad), say: I have surrendered my purpose to Allah and (so have) those who follow me. And say unto those who have received the Scripture and those who read not: Have ye (too) surrendered ? If they surrender, then truly they are rightly guided, and if they turn away, then it is thy duty only to convey the message (unto them). Allah is Seer of (His) bondmen.",So if they the disbelievers dispute with you O Muhammad (s) concerning religion say to them ‘I have surrendered my countenance to God that is to say I have submitted to Him I and whoever follows me’ wajh ‘countenance’ is chosen here because of its noble character for the other parts of the body will just as soon surrender once the countenance has; and say to those who have been given the Scripture the Jews and the Christians and to the uninstructed the Arab idolaters ‘Have you submitted?’ that is to say ‘Submit!’ And so if they have submitted they have been guided from error but if they turn their backs to Islam your duty is only to deliver the Message; and God sees His servants and so requites them for their deeds — this statement was revealed before the command to fight them had been revealed.

So give them good tidings let them know of a painful chastisement. The use of ‘good tidings’ here is meant as a sarcastic ridicule of them the fā’ of fa-bashshirhum so give them good tidings is considered part of the predicate of inna because its noun that is its relative clause resembles a conditional sc. in yakfurūna ‘if they disbelieve…’ fa-bashshirhum ‘then give them good tidings…’.

When the Torah was brought and consulted the same verdict was found and so the two were stoned but they the Jews became wrathful.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,24,That is because they say: The Fire will not touch us save for a certain number of days. That which they used to invent hath deceived them regarding their religion.,That turning away and rejection was because they said ‘the Fire shall not touch us except for a number of days’ that is for forty days only the length of time their forefathers worshipped the calf after which it would end; and the lies they used to invent in their saying this have deluded them in their religion wa-gharrahum fī dīnihim ‘it has deluded them in their religion’ is semantically connected to mā kānū yaftarūna ‘the lies which they used to invent’.

Thou, only Thou, art the Hearer, the Knower!",Mention when the wife of ‘Imrān Hanna said after she had reached old age and longed for a child and supplicated to God and sensed that she was carrying child ‘O Lord I have vowed to offer You what is within my womb as a consecration one liberated and delivered from the distractions of this world for the service of Your Holy House in Jerusalem. Accept this from me. Lo! It is You Who are the Hearer of petition the Knower of intentions. ‘Imrān died while she was still pregnant.
The Family of 'Imrân,3,36,"And when she was delivered she said: My Lord! Lo! I am delivered of a female - Allah knew best of what she was delivered - the male is not as the female; and lo! I have named her Mary, and lo! I crave Thy protection for her and for her offspring from Satan the outcast.",And when she gave birth to her a girl and she had been hoping for a boy since only males were consecrated to the service of God she said apologetically ‘O Lord I have given birth to a female’ — and God knew very well what she had given birth to a parenthetical statement constituting God’s speech a variant reading for wada‘at ‘she gave birth’ has wada‘tu ‘I gave birth’ making these Hanna’s words sc. ‘and God knows very well what I have given birth to’; the male that she had asked for is not as the female that was bestowed upon her because he is designed for the service of God while she would not be suitable on account of her lesser physical ability her private parts the effects of menstruation on her and so on. ‘And I have named her Mary and commend her to You with her seed her children to protect them from the accursed the outcast Satan’.

Allah giveth without stint to whom He will.",Her Lord accepted the child that is He received Mary from her mother with gracious acceptance and made her grow excellently He made her grow up with excellent character. She would grow in a day by as much as a new-born grew during a year. Her mother took her to the priests the keepers of the Holy House of Jerusalem and said ‘This here before you is the dedication I offered’. They competed for guardianship of her because she was the daughter of their religious leader at which point Zachariah said ‘I am most worthy of her for her maternal aunt lives with me’. The others said ‘No not until we have cast lots’. Thus all twenty nine of them departed to the River Jordan where they cast their quills agreeing that the one whose quill remained fast and floated to the surface of the water would be most worthy of being guardian over her. Zachariah’s quill remained fast and surfaced. He took charge of her and built for her a gallery-room with a ladder in the temple and none apart from him went up to her. He used to bring her food drink and oil and would find her with summer fruits in winter and winter fruits in summer just as God says and Zachariah took charge of her he took her to him a variant reading of kafalahā ‘he took charge of her’ is kaffalahā ‘He God gave Zachariah charge of her’ with Zakariyyā’ or Zakariyyā in the accusative and ‘God’ as the subject of the verb. Whenever Zachariah went into the sanctuary that is the room the most noble seat in the temple where she was he found her with provisions. ‘O Mary’ he said ‘Whence comes this to you?’ She still very young said ‘From God He sends it to me from Paradise’ ‘Truly God provides abundant provision for whomever He will without reckoning’ without consequence.

Jesus may be distinguished from the work of the Creator namely God exalted be He and that he might know that perfection belongs to God alone. I will also heal the blind akmah is one that is blind from birth and the leper; these two are singled out for mention because with both afflictions the person is completely helpless. He Jesus was sent in an age of characterised by medicinal science and he cured through supplication fifty thousand in one day on the condition that each person would become a believer; and I bring to life the dead by the leave of God — He repeats this to preclude any false attributions of divinity to him — he brought back to life his friend ‘Āzar the son of an old woman and the daughter of the tithe-collector all of whom lived on and produced offspring and he also brought back to life Shem son of Noah but he died again immediately.

He then said to her ‘Verily the Resurrection shall bring us together again’. This took place on the Night of Ordainment laylat al-qadr in the Holy House of Jerusalem when he was thirty three years old. His mother lived on after him for six years.

In a hadīth recorded by Muslim he will remain for seven years; according to Abū Dāwūd al-Tayālisī he will remain for forty years and he will die and have prayers performed over him. It is possible that what is meant by the forty years is the total time he will have spent on earth before he was raised and afterwards.

Let us call our sons and your sons our wives and your wives our selves and your selves and gather them together then let us humbly pray and invoke God’s curse upon those who lie’ by saying ‘Lord curse the one that tells lies concerning the affair of Jesus’. The Prophet s had called upon the Najrān delegation to do this when they disputed with him about Jesus. They said ‘Let us think about it and we will come back to you’. The judicious one among them said ‘You know that he is a prophet and that every people that has ever challenged a prophet to a mutual imprecation has been destroyed’. They left him and departed. When they went to see the Prophet s who had set out with al-Hasan al-Husayn Fātima and ‘Alī he said to them the Najrān delegation ‘When I supplicate you say ‘Amen’; but they refrained from this mutual imprecation and made peace with the Prophet on the condition that they pay the jizya as reported by Abū Nu‘aym.

When this was revealed they found it difficult to maintain guardianship over orphans and some of them had ten or eight wives under their care and did not treat them all equally and so the following was revealed
Women,4,3,"And if ye fear that ye will not deal fairly by the orphans, marry of the women, who seem good to you, two or three or four; and if ye fear that ye cannot do justice (to so many) then one (only) or (the captives) that your right hands possess. Thus it is more likely that ye will not do injustice.",If you fear that you will not act justly that you will not be equitable towards the orphans and are thus distressed in this matter then also fear lest you be unjust towards women when you marry them; marry such mā means man women as seem good to you two or three or four that is each man may marry two or three or four but do not exceed this; but if you fear you will not be equitable towards them in terms of their expenses and individual share; then marry only one or restrict yourself to what your right hands own of slavegirls since these do not have the same rights as wives; thus by that marrying of only four or only one or resorting to slavegirls it is likelier it is nearer in outcome that you will not be unjust that you will not be inequitable.

If any man who is a guardian is rich let him be abstinent that is let him abstain from the orphan’s property and refrain from consuming it; if he is poor let him consume of it honourably that is in line with the wage for his work. And when you deliver to them the orphans their property take witnesses over them that they have received it and that you are absolved of the obligation so that if any dispute occurs you are able to refer to a clear proof this is a command intended for guidance. God suffices as a reckoner as a guardian of His creatures’ deeds and as a reckoner of these deeds the bā’ in bi’Llāhi is extra.
Women,4,7,"Unto the men (of a family) belongeth a share of that which parents and near kindred leave, and unto the women a share of that which parents and near kindred leave, whether it be little or much - a legal share.",The following was revealed as a repudiation of pre-Islamic practices in which women and children were not given any inheritance To the men young ones and kin belongs a share a portion of what deceased parents and kinsmen leave and to the women belongs a share of what parents and kinsmen leave whether it the property be little or much. God has made it an obligatory share apportioned to be given to them.
Women,4,8,"And when kinsfolk and orphans and the needy are present at the division (of the heritage), bestow on them therefrom and speak kindly unto them.",And when the division of the inheritance is attended by kinsmen those of kinship who cannot inherit and orphans and the poor grant them something out of it before the division is effected; and if the inheritors are young speak to them O guardians honourable words kindly by apologising to them that it is not your possession to divide as you wish but that it is for the young inheritors. Some say that this stipulation was abrogated; others say that it was not only that people were all too readily neglecting it since it was encouraged but not prescribed. According to Ibn ‘Abbās however it is a duty.
Women,4,9,"And let those fear (in their behaviour toward orphans) who if they left behind them weak offspring would be afraid for them. So let them mind their duty to Allah, and speak justly.",And let them fear let them be concerned for the orphans those who if they are about to leave behind them that is after their death weak offspring young children would be afraid for them; that they be ruined; let them fear God in the matter concerning orphans and let them give what they would love for their own offspring after their death; and speak to the one approached by death pertinent words the right words by enjoining him to give as voluntary almsgiving no more than the third of the inheritance and leave the remainder for the ones inheriting so that they do not end up as dependants.
Women,4,10,"Lo! Those who devour the wealth of orphans wrongfully, they do but swallow fire into their bellies, and they will be exposed to burning flame.",Those who consume the property of orphans unjustly without any right are only consuming the whole of it as fire in their bellies because that is where such action leads and they shall be exposed to read active yaslawna or passive yuslawna that is they shall enter a blaze an intense fire in which they shall burn.
Women,4,11,"Allah chargeth you concerning (the provision for) your children: to the male the equivalent of the portion of two females, and if there be women more than two, then theirs is two-thirds of the inheritance, and if there be one (only) then the half. And to each of his parents a sixth of the inheritance, if he have a son; and if he have no son and his parents are his heirs, then to his mother appertaineth the third; and if he have brethren, then to his mother appertaineth the sixth, after any legacy he may have bequeathed, or debt (hath been paid). Your parents and your children: Ye know not which of them is nearer unto you in usefulness. It is an injunction from Allah. Lo! Allah is Knower, Wise.",God charges you He commands you concerning the matter of your children with what He will mention to the male of them the equivalent of the portion the lot of two females if there are two women with him so that half the property is his and the other half is theirs; if there is only one female with him then she has a third and he receives two thirds; if he is the only one he takes it all; and if they the offspring be only women more than two then for them two-thirds of what he the deceased leaves; likewise if they be two women since in the case of two sisters more deserving of such a share God says They shall receive two-thirds of what he leaves Q. 4176; and since a female is entitled to a third with a male she is all the more deserving of the same share with a female. It is said that fawq ‘more than’ introduces a relative clause; it is also said to guard against the wrong impression that the greater the number of females the greater the portion they are entitled to since it is mistakenly thought that the entitlement of two females to two-thirds derives from the fact that a female is entitled to one third when with a male; but if she the daughter be one wāhidatan is also read wāhidatun making the kāna construction syntactically complete then to her a half; and to his parents the deceased’s to each one of the two li-kulli wāhidin minhumā substitutes for the previous li-abawayhi ‘to his parents’ the sixth of what he leaves if he has a child male or female the point of the substitution is to show that they do not share the sixth but receive one each. The term ‘child’ walad also applies to a grandchild and likewise ‘parent’ abb to a grandparent; but if he has no child and his heirs are his parents alone or along with a spouse then to his mother read li-ummihi; also read in both places here and further down li-immihi in order to avoid the cumbersome transition from a damma ‘u’ to a kasra ‘I’ a third of the property or what remains after the spouse the rest being for the father; or if he has siblings two or more males or females to his mother a sixth and the rest for the father and nothing for the siblings.
Women,4,12,"And unto you belongeth a half of that which your wives leave, if they have no child; but if they have a child then unto you the fourth of that which they leave, afte r any legacy they may have bequeathed, or debt (they ma y have contracted, hath been paid). And unto them belon geth the fourth of that which ye leave if ye have no ch ild, but if ye have a child then the eighth of that whi ch ye leave, after any legacy ye may have bequeathed, o r debt (ye may have contracted, hath been paid). And if a man or a woman have a distant heir (having left neit her parent nor child), and he (or she) have a brother o r a sister (only on the mother’s side) then to each of them twain (the brother and the sister) the sixth, and if they be more than two, then they shall be sharers in the third, after any legacy that may have been bequeat hed or debt (contracted) not injuring (the heirs by wil ling away more than a third of the heritage) hath been",And for you a half of what your wives leave if they have no children from you or from another; but if they have children then for you a fourth of what they leave after any bequest they may bequeath or any debt the consensus is that the grandchild in this case is like the child. And for them the wives whether one or more a fourth of what you leave if you have no children; but if you have children from them or from others then for them an eighth of what you leave after any bequest you may bequeath or any debt; again the consensus is that the grandchild is as the child. If it be a man leaving an inheritance yūrathu ‘being inherited from’ is an adjectival qualification the predicate of which is the following kalālatan ‘without direct heir’ and not having a direct heir that is having neither a parent nor child or it be a woman leaving an inheritance and having no direct heir but it be that such a man leaving an inheritance with no direct heir has a brother or a sister from the same mother as read by Ibn Mas‘ūd and others then to each of the two a sixth of what he leaves; but if they the siblings from the same mother be more than that that is more than one then they share a third the male and female equally after any bequest to be bequeathed or any debt without prejudice ghayra mudārrin is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person governing the verb yūsā ‘to be bequeathed’ in other words without causing any prejudice to the inheritors by bequeathing more than the third; a charge wasiyyatan a verbal noun reaffirming the import of yūsīkum ‘He charges you’ of the beginning of the previous verse from God. God is Knowing of the obligations which He has ordained for His creatures Forbearing in deferring the punishment of those that disobey Him. The Sunna specifies that the individuals mentioned may receive the relevant inheritance provided that they are not barred from it on account of their having committed murder or their belonging to a different religion or being slaves.
Women,4,13,"These are the limits (imposed by) Allah. Whoso obeyeth Allah and His messenger, He will make him enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow, where such will dwell for ever. That will be the great success.",Those rulings mentioned with respect to orphans and what followed are God’s bounds His laws which He has delimited for His servants so that they may act in accordance with them and not infringe them. Whoever obeys God and His Messenger in what He has ruled He will admit him yudkhilhu or as a shift to the first person plural read nudkhilhu ‘We will admit him’ to Gardens underneath which rivers flow abiding therein; that is the great triumph.
Women,4,14,"And whoso disobeyeth Allah and His messenger and transgresseth His limits, He will make him enter Fire, where he will dwell for ever; his will be a shameful doom.",But whoever disobeys God and His Messenger; and transgresses His bounds him He will admit read in both ways as above yudkhilhu and nudkhilhu to a Fire abiding therein and for him in it there shall be a humbling chastisement one of humiliation. In both of the last verses the singular person of the suffixed pronouns and the verbs accords with the singular form of the particle man ‘whoever’ while the plural person in khālidīn ‘abiding’ accords with its general plural import.
Women,4,15,"As for those of your women who are guilty of lewdness, call to witness four of you against them. And if they testify (to the truth of the allegation) then confine them to the houses until death take them or (until) Allah appoint for them a way (through new legislation).",As for those of your women who commit lewdness adultery call four Muslim men of you to witness against them; and if they witness against them such lewdness then detain them in their houses and prevent them from mixing with people until the angels of death take them or until God appoints for them a way out of it. This was stipulated for them at the very beginning of Islam but then a way out was appointed for them through the stipulation that the virgin should receive a hundred lashes and be banished for a year and the married woman be stoned. The prescribed punishment was explained thus in the hadīth ‘Come listen to me! Come listen to me! God has now made a way out for them’ as reported by Muslim.
Women,4,16,"And as for the two of you who are guilty thereof, punish them both. And if they repent and improve, then let them be. Lo! Allah is ever relenting, Merciful.",And when two of you read wa’lladhāni or wa’lladhānni men commit it that is a lewd act adultery or homosexual intercourse punish them both with insults and beatings with sandals; but if they repent of this lewd act and make amends through good action then leave them be and do not harm them. God ever turns relenting to those who repent and is Merciful to them. This verse is abrogated by the prescribed punishment if adultery is meant by the lewd act and similarly if homosexual intercourse is meant according to al-Shāfi‘ī; but according to him the person who is the object of the penetrative act is not stoned even if he be married; rather he is flogged and banished. Judging by the dual person pronoun it seems more obvious that homosexual fornication is meant by this verse even though the former sc. al-Shāfi‘ī was of the opinion that it referred to an adulterer and an adulteress; but this opinion of his may be countered by the fact that the reference to the two men becomes clear on account of the particle min being attached to a masculine pronoun minkum ‘of you’ and by the fact that they suffer the same punishment both effect the action of repentance and are both granted that they be left alone thereafter all of which applies specifically to men given that for women detention is stipulated as was stated before.
Women,4,17,"Forgiveness is only incumbent on Allah toward those who do evil in ignorance (and) then turn quickly (in repentance) to Allah. These are they toward whom Allah relenteth. Allah is ever Knower, Wise.",The repentance that God accepts that is the one which He has prescribed for Himself to accept out of His bounty is only of those who do evil an act of disobedience in ignorance bi-jahālatin a circumstantial qualifier in other words ‘they are ignorant’ while they are disobeying their Lord; then repent shortly thereafter before the last gasps of death; God will relent to those He will accept their repentance. And God is ever Knowing of His creatures Wise in what He does with them.
Women,4,18,"The forgiveness is not for those who do ill-deeds until, when death attendeth upon one of them, he saith: Lo! I repent now; nor yet for those who die while they are disbelievers. For such We have prepared a painful doom.",Repentance is not for those who do evil deeds sins until when death approaches one of them and the pangs of death begin he says upon witnessing his predicament ‘Indeed now I repent’ for this would not avail him and would not be accepted from him; neither for those who die disbelieving if they repent in the Hereafter upon seeing the chastisement it will not be accepted from them. Those — We have prepared for them a painful chastisement.
Women,4,19,"O ye who believe! It is not lawful for you forcibly to inherit the women (of your deceased kinsmen), nor (that) ye should put constraint upon them that ye may take away a part of that which ye have given them, unless they be guilty of flagrant lewdness. But consort with them in kindness, for if ye hate them it may happen that ye hate a thing wherein Allah hath placed much good.",O you who believe it is not lawful for you to inherit women against their will read either karhan or kurhan as alternative forms that is to say coercing them into this. In pre-Islamic times they used to inherit women from their kin and if they so wished they could marry a woman without a dowry or marry her off and take the dowry for themselves or prevent her from marriage until she gave up what she had inherited or until she died and they could inherit from her. They were thus forbidden such practices; neither debar them your former wives from marrying others by retaining them while you have no desire for them yourselves only to harm them; so that you may go off with part of what you have given them of the dowry except when they commit flagrant read mubayyina ‘making it clear’ or mubayyana ‘clear’ lewdness such as adultery or rebellion then you have the right to coerce them until they redeem themselves to you or forfeit their dowries. Consort with them in kindness that is being decent in speaking to them with regard to their expenditure and lodging; for if you hate them then be patient; it may happen that you hate a thing wherein God has set much good that is to say perhaps He does this when He provides you with a righteous child through them.

Would you take it by way of calumny injustice and manifest sin? buhtānan ‘calumny’ and ithman ‘sin’ end in the accusative because they are circumstantial qualifiers; the interrogative here is meant as a rebuke and as a disavowal where He says

Lawful for you read passive wa-uhilla or active wa-ahalla beyond all that that is except what He has forbidden you of women is that you seek women using your wealth by way of a dowry or a price in wedlock and not fornicating in illicitly.

Ye (proceed) one from another; so wed them by permission of their folk, and give unto them their portions in kindness, they being honest, not debauched nor of loose conduct. And if when they are honourably married they commit lewdness they shall incur the half of the punishment (prescribed) for free women (in that case).

God knows very well your faith so suffice yourself with its outward manifestation and leave the innermost matters to Him for He is the One to know her true merit many a slavegirl may be more excellent in faith than a free woman and this is meant to encourage marriage with slavegirls; the one of you is as the other being equal in religion so do not disdain to marry with them. So marry them with the permission of their folk their guardians and give them their wages their dowries honourably without procrastination or diminution as women in wedlock muhsanāt a circumstantial qualifier in decency not illicitly openly fornicating or taking lovers companions fornicating in secret.

Here God has not made wedlock the precondition for the prescribed punishment to show that stoning does not apply in their case sc. slavegirls. That marrying of slavegirls on account of insufficient means is for those of you who fear the distress of sin fornication al-‘anat originally means distress but is used to mean zinā ‘fornication’ because of the distress that it causes in the way of the punishment in this world and in the Hereafter as opposed to those of you who might not have such a fear of distress with regard to their free women and for whom it is unlawful to marry her the slavegirl; likewise for one who has sufficient means to marry a free woman it is unlawful for him to marry a slavegirl instead this is the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī. Moreover God’s words ‘believing maids’ precludes unbelieving women whom it is unlawful to marry even if one should find no believing women and fear the distress of fornication; yet it is better for you to be patient and abstain from marrying slavegirls lest the child should become enslaved also. God is Forgiving Merciful by allowing room for manoeuvre in these matters.

Allah is Benign, Forgiving.",O you who believe draw not near to prayer that is do not perform prayer whilst you are inebriated by a drink this was revealed concerning being drunk during the congregational prayer; until you know what you are saying when you have sobered up; nor whilst you are defiled as a result of sexual penetration or ejaculation junuban ‘defiled’ is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier and may be used to refer to the singular or plural — unless you are traversing crossing a way a route that is unless you are travelling — until you have washed yourselves in which case you may perform prayer a proviso is made for the traveller because a different stipulation applies to him as will follow. It is said that the purpose of this verse is to prohibit the approach to places of prayer that is mosques the exception being if one were merely passing through and not staying. But if you are sick with an illness made worse by contact with water or on a journey that is or travelling whilst you are ritually defiled or impure or if any of you comes from the privy al-ghā’it a place designated for relieving nature that is to say or if any of you have defecated or you have touched women lāmastum a variant reading has lamastum both mean lams that is ‘touching with the hand’ as stated by Ibn ‘Umar; this is also the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī and it extends to touching with other parts of the skin; according to Ibn ‘Abbās however it is referring to sexual intercourse; and you can find no water with which to purify yourselves for prayer having made the effort to seek it out and search for it — the sick being exempt in this case — then resort to seek when the time for the prayer has commenced wholesome soil clean earth strike it twice and wipe your faces and your hands with it up to the elbows the verb masaha ‘to wipe’ may stand on its own with a direct object or take a particle before the direct object sc. masaha bi-. God is ever Pardoning Forgiving.
Women,4,44,"Seest thou not those unto whom a portion of the Scripture hath been given, how they purchase error, and seek to make you (Muslims) err from the right way ?",Have you not seen those who were given a share a portion of the Book namely the Jews purchasing error with guidance and desiring that you should err from the way? that you should stray from the path of truth and be like them.
Women,4,45,"Allah knoweth best (who are) your enemies. Allah is sufficient as a Guardian, and Allah is sufficient as a Supporter.",God has better knowledge of your enemies than you do and He informs you of them in order that you avoid them. God suffices as a Protector a Preserver of you from them God suffices as a Helper defending you against their plotting.
Women,4,46,"Some of those who are Jews change words from their context and say: ""We hear and disobey; hear thou as one who heareth not"" and ""Listen to us!"" distorting with their tongues and slandering religion. If they had said: ""We hear and we obey: hear thou, and look at us"" it had been better for them, and more upright. But Allah hath cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not, save a few.",Some group from among the Jews distort alter the words that God revealed in the Torah pertaining to the descriptions of Muhammad (s) from their contexts those contexts in which they were placed and they say to the Prophet s when he commands them something ‘We have heard your words and we disobey your command; and hear as one who does not hear’ wa’sma‘ ghayr musma‘in is a circumstantial qualifier functioning as an invocation in other words ‘And may you not hear!’ and they say to him ‘Mind us’ rā‘inā a term with which it had been forbidden to address him being a curse word in their language; twisting distorting with their tongues and slandering defaming religion Islam. If they had said ‘We have heard and obey’ instead of ‘And we disobey’ and only ‘Hear’ and ‘Consider us’ unzur ilaynā instead of rā‘inā it would have been better for them than what they said and more upright more just than that but God has cursed them removing them from His mercy for their unbelief so they believe not except a few among them such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions.
Women,4,47,"O ye unto whom the Scripture hath been given! Believe in what We have revealed confirming that which ye possess, before We destroy countenances so as to confound them, or curse them as We cursed the Sabbath-breakers (of old time). The commandment of Allah is always executed.",O you who have been given the Scripture believe in what We have revealed of the Qur’ān confirming what is with you of the Torah before We obliterate faces erasing the eyes noses and eyebrows in them and turn them inside out and make them like the napes of the neck a flat plate or curse them by transforming them into apes as We cursed as We transformed those of the Sabbath among them and God’s command His decree is done after this was revealed ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām converted to Islam and so it was said that this had been a conditional threat of punishment so that when some of them converted to Islam it the threat was lifted. It is also said that obliteration and transformation will take place before the rising of the Hour.
Women,4,48,"Lo! Allah forgiveth not that a partner should be ascribed unto Him. He forgiveth (all) save that to whom He will. Whoso ascribeth partners to Allah, he hath indeed invented a tremendous sin.",God forgives not that anything should be associated with Him. But He forgives other than save that of sins to whomever He wills forgiveness for by admitting him into Paradise without punishment. And whomever He wills of the believers He punishes for their sins and then admits them into Paradise. Whoever associates anything with God then he has indeed invented a tremendous a great sin.
Women,4,49,"Hast thou not seen those who praise themselves for purity ? Nay, Allah purifieth whom He will, and they will not be wronged even the hair upon a date-stone.",Have you not seen those who praise themselves for purity? namely the Jews when they say ‘We are God’s children and His beloved’ in other words it is not a matter of their purifying themselves. Nay God purifies whom He will through faith and they shall not be wronged they shall not be diminished of their deeds a single date-thread as much as the peel on a date-stone.
Women,4,50,"See, how they invent lies about Allah! That of itself is flagrant sin.",Consider in amazement how they invent falsehood against God in that way and that suffices for a clear an evident sin.
Women,4,51,"Hast thou not seen those unto whom a portion of the Scripture hath been given, how they believe in idols and false deities, and how they say of those (idolaters) who disbelieve: ""These are more rightly guided than those who believe"" ?",The following was revealed regarding Ka‘b b. al-Ashraf and other such scholars from among the Jews when they came to Mecca and saw those killed at Badr and began to incite the idolaters to avenge them their dead by waging war against the Prophet s Have you not seen those who were given a share of the Book how they believe in al-Jibt and al-Tāghūt two idols belonging to Quraysh and say to the disbelievers to Abū Sufyān and his companions when they the latter said to them ‘Are we who are the guardians of the House who give drink to the pilgrim offer hospitality to the guest set free the captive and do such and such … not more rightly guided than Muhammad he who has contravened the religion of his forefathers severed the ties of kinship and abandoned the Sanctuary?’ ‘These in other words you are more rightly guided upon a more upright way than the believers’?
Women,4,52,"Those are they whom Allah hath cursed, and he whom Allah hath cursed, thou (O Muhammad) wilt find for him no helper.",Those are the ones whom God has cursed; and he whom God has cursed you will never find for him any helper anyone to protect him from His chastisement.
Women,4,53,"Or have they even a share in the Sovereignty ? Then in that case, they would not give mankind even the speck on a date-stone.",Or have they a share in the Kingdom? that is to say they have no share in it whatever and even if they did then they would not give the people a single date-spot that is not even something as worthless as the tiny spot on the back of a date-pit because of the extent of their niggardliness.
Women,4,54,"Or are they jealous of mankind because of that which Allah of His bounty hath bestowed upon them ? For We bestowed upon the house of Abraham (of old) the Scripture and wisdom, and We bestowed on them a mighty kingdom.",Or nay are they jealous of people namely of the Prophet s for the bounty that God has bestowed upon them in the way of prophethood and abundance of women? In other words they wish that he be deprived of such things saying ‘If he were truly a prophet he would not be concerned with women’. For We gave the House of Abraham his forefather the likes of Moses David and Solomon the Book and wisdom and prophethood and We gave them a mighty kingdom David had ninety–nine women and Solomon had a thousand free women and slavegirls.
Women,4,55,And of them were (some) who believed therein and of them were (some) who turned away from it. Hell is sufficient for (their) burning.,And there are some of them who believe in him in Muhammad (s) and some of them who bar from him who reject him and do not believe. Hell suffices for a blaze as a chastisement for those who do not believe.
Women,4,56,"Lo! Those who disbelieve Our revelations, We shall expose them to the Fire. As often as their skins are consumed We shall exchange them for fresh skins that they may taste the torment. Lo! Allah is ever Mighty, Wise.",Surely those who disbelieve in Our signs — We shall expose them We shall admit them to a Fire wherein they shall burn; as often as their skins are consumed burnt We shall replace them with other skins restoring them to their initial unburnt state that they may taste the chastisement that they may suffer its severity. Surely God is ever Mighty nothing being beyond His power Wise in His creation.
Women,4,57,"And as for those who believe and do good works, We shall make them enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow - to dwell therein for ever; there for them are pure companions - and We shall make them enter plenteous shade.",And those that believe and perform righteous deeds We shall admit them to Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they abide they shall have therein spouses purified of menstruation and every impurity and We shall admit them to plenteous shade that is everlasting shade never replaced by any sun and this is the shade of Paradise.
Women,4,58,"Lo! Allah commandeth you that ye restore deposits to their owners, and, if ye judge between mankind, that ye judge justly. Lo! comely is this which Allah admonisheth you. Lo! Allah is ever Hearer, Seer.",Verily God commands you to restore trusts that is the rights entrusted to you by others back to their owners this was revealed when ‘Alī may God be pleased with him took the key of the Ka‘ba from its keeper ‘Uthmān b. Talha al-Hajabī by force upon the arrival of the Prophet s in Mecca in the year of the Conquest after he ‘Uthmān had tried to prevent him ‘Alī from taking it saying ‘If I had known that he was the Messenger of God I would not have prevented him’. The Messenger of God s then ordered him ‘Alī to give it back to him ‘Uthmān saying to him ‘Here you are it is yours now and always’. He ‘Uthmān was amazed by this whereupon ‘Alī recited to him this verse and he accepted Islam. Upon his death he ‘Uthmān gave it the key to his brother Shayba and thus it remained in the keep of his descendants. Although the verse was revealed regarding a specific occasion it holds true in general on account of the plural person to which it is addressed. And when you judge between people He commands that you judge with justice. Excellent is ni‘immā the mīm of ni‘ima has been assimilated with the indefinite particle mā which is the object described in other words na‘ima shay’an ‘an excellent thing is’ the admonition God gives you to restore a trust and to judge with justice. God is ever Hearer of what is said Seer of what is done.
Women,4,59,"O ye who believe! Obey Allah, and obey the messenger and those of you who are in authority; and if ye have a dispute concerning any matter, refer it to Allah and the messenger if ye are (in truth) believers in Allah and the Last Day. That is better and more seemly in the end.",O you who believe obey God and obey the Messenger and those in authority among you that is rulers when they command you to obey God and His Messenger. If you should quarrel disagree about anything refer it to God that is to His Book and the Messenger while he lives and thereafter refer to his Sunna in other words examine these disputes with reference to these two sources if you believe in God and the Last Day; that reference to the two sources is better for you than quarrelling or adhering to personal opinions and more excellent in interpretation in the end.
Women,4,60,"Hast thou not seen those who pretend that they believe in that which is revealed unto thee and that which was revealed before thee, how they would go for judgment (in their disputes) to false deities when they have been ordered to abjure them ? Satan would mislead them far astray.",The following verse was revealed when a Jew and a hypocrite fell into a dispute. The hypocrite called on Ka‘b b. al-Ashraf to arbitrate between them while the Jew called on the Prophet s. When they came to him the Prophet ruled in favour of the Jew. But the hypocrite was not satisfied and so they went before ‘Umar. The Jew told him what had happened whereupon he ‘Umar turned to the hypocrite and asked him ‘Is this true?’ and when he replied ‘Yes’ he ‘Umar killed him. Have you not seen those who claim that they believe in what has been revealed to you and what was revealed before you desiring to take their disputes to a false deity tāghūt one excessive in tempting others to falsehood tughyān namely Ka‘b b. al-Ashraf when they have been commanded to renounce him? and not to associate with him. But Satan desires to mislead them far astray from the truth.
Women,4,61,"And when it is said unto them: Come unto that which Allah hath revealed and unto the messenger, thou seest the hypocrites turn from thee with aversion.",And when it is said to them ‘Come to what God has revealed as regards rulings in the Qur’ān and the Messenger’ that he may judge between you you see the hypocrites turn away from you vehemently to others.
Women,4,62,"How would it be if a misfortune smote them because of that which their own hands have sent before (them) ? Then would they come unto thee, swearing by Allah that they were seeking naught but harmony and kindness.",How would it be what would they do when an affliction a punishment befalls them for what their own hands have sent before them of unbelief and acts of disobedience that is to say would they then be able to turn away and escape it? No! They then come to you thumma jā’ūka a supplement to yasuddūn ‘they turn away’ of the previous verse swearing by God that in turning to other than you for arbitration ‘We sought only virtue settlement and harmony’ reconciliation between the disputing parties by any approximate judgement without regard for the painful truth.
Women,4,63,"Those are they, the secrets of whose hearts Allah knoweth. So oppose them and admonish them, and address them in plain terms about their souls.",Those — God knows what is in their hearts in the way of hypocrisy and the mendacity of their excuses; so turn away from them with forgiveness and admonish them make them fear God and say to them regarding the issue of their souls penetrating words affecting them in other words reprimand them so that they repent of their unbelief.
Women,4,64,"We sent no messenger save that he should be obeyed by Allah’s leave. And if, when they had wronged themselves, they had but come unto thee and asked forgiveness of Allah, and asked forgiveness of the messenger, they would have found Allah Forgiving, Merciful.",We never sent any Messenger but that he should be obeyed in what he commands and judges by the leave by the command of God and not that he should be disobeyed or opposed. If when they had wronged themselves by seeking the judgement of the false idol they had come to you repentant and asked forgiveness from God and the Messenger had asked forgiveness for them there is a shift from the second to the third person in this address in deference to his the Prophet’s s status; they would have found God Relenting to them Merciful to them.
Women,4,65,"But nay, by thy Lord, they will not believe (in truth) until they make thee judge of what is in dispute between them and find within themselves no dislike of that which thou decidest, and submit with full submission.",But no fa-lā the lā is extra by your Lord! They will not believe until they make you judge over what has broken out has become mixed up between them and find in themselves no inhibition no constraint or doubt regarding what you decide but submit but comply with your ruling in full submission without objection.
Women,4,66,"And if We had decreed for them: Lay down your lives or go forth from your dwellings, but few of them would have done it; though if they did what they are exhorted to do it would be better for them, and more strengthening;",And had We prescribed for them the particle an ‘that’ is explicative ‘Slay yourselves’ or ‘Leave your habitations’ as We did for the Children of Israel they would not have done it that is what has been prescribed for them save a few read nominative qalīlun as a substitution; or read accusative qalīlan as an exceptive clause of them; yet if they had done what they were admonished to do of obedience to the Messenger s it would have been better for them and stronger in establishing a stronger confirmation of their faith.
Women,4,67,"And then We should bestow upon them from Our presence an immense reward,",And then that is had they confirmed themselves We would have surely given them from Us a great wage that is Paradise.
Women,4,68,And should guide them unto a straight path.,And We would have guided them to a straight path. Some Companions said to the Prophet s ‘How will we be able to see you in Paradise when you will be in the highest stations and we will be lower than you?’ and so the following was revealed
Women,4,69,"Whoso obeyeth Allah and the messenger, they are with those unto whom Allah hath shown favour, of the prophets and the saints and the martyrs and the righteous. The best of company are they!",Whoever obeys God and the Messenger in what he commands they are with those whom God has blessed of the prophets and the truthful that is the most excellent of the Prophet’s Companions because of the fullness of their truthfulness and their affirmation of the truth; and the martyrs those slain in the path of God; and the righteous all those other than the ones mentioned. What fine companions they are! in Paradise since in it one will enjoy seeing them visiting them and being in their presence even though they will be in the highest stations in relation to others.
Women,4,70,"That is bounty from Allah, and Allah sufficeth as Knower.",That namely their being with those mentioned dhālika ‘that’ is the subject the predicate of which is the following is bounty from God with which He has favoured them and not because they have earned it through their obedience. God suffices as Knower of the reward of the Hereafter in other words trust in what He has told you None can tell you like One Who is aware Q. 3514.
Women,4,71,"O ye who believe! Take your precautions, then advance the proven ones, or advance all together. .",O you who believe take your precautions against your enemy that is be wary of him and be vigilant against him; then move forward prepare to fight him in companies in separate groups one raiding party followed by the next; or move forward all together in one assembly.
Women,4,72,"Lo! among you there is he who loitereth; and if disaster overtook you, he would say: Allah hath been gracious unto me since I was not present with them.",Verily there are some of you who tarry who indeed hesitate to join the fighting such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy the hypocrite and his companions — counting him the one who tarries as one of them the Muslims is from the perspective of outward appearances — the lām in the verb la-yubatti’anna ‘verily … who tarry’ is for oaths; then if an affliction befalls you such as slaughter or defeat he says ‘God has been gracious to me for I was not a witness with them’ present at the fighting lest I should be hurt.
Women,4,73,"And if a bounty from Allah befell you, he would surely cry, as if there had been no love between you and him: Oh, would that I had been with them, then should I have achieved a great success!",But if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths a bounty from God befalls you such as a conquest or booty he will surely cry in regret as if ka’an is softened its subject having been omitted in other words it should be ka’annahu there had never been read lam yakun or lam takun any affection any acquaintance or friendship between you and him this statement refers back to the words in the previous verse ‘God has been gracious to me’ and comes as a parenthesis between the statement ‘that he will cry’ and the very words he cries which are ‘Oh yā is for exclamation would that I had been with them so that I might have won a great triumph!’ that is that I might have taken a good share of the booty.
Women,4,74,"Let those fight in the way of Allah who sell the life of this world for the other. Whoso fighteth in the way of Allah, be he slain or be he victorious, on him We shall bestow a vast reward.",God exalted be He says So let them fight in the way of God to elevate His religion those who sell the life of this world for the Hereafter; and whoever fights in the way of God and is slain dies a martyr or conquers overcomes his enemy We shall give him a great wage a plentiful reward.
Women,4,75,"How should ye not fight for the cause of Allah and of the feeble among men and of the women and the children who are crying: Our Lord! Bring us forth from out this town of which the people are oppressors! Oh, give us from thy presence some protecting friend! Oh, give us from Thy presence some defender!",What is wrong with you that you do not fight this is an interrogative of rebuke in other words there is nothing to prevent you from fighting in the way of God and for the deliverance of the oppressed men women and children whom the disbelievers persecuted and prevented from emigrating. Ibn ‘Abbās may God be pleased with him and his father said ‘My mother and I were among them’; who say supplicating ‘O our Lord bring us forth from this town Mecca whose people are evildoers through unbelief and appoint for us a protector from You to take charge of our affair and appoint for us from You a helper’ to defend us against them. God responded to their supplication and facilitated escape for some of them while others remained behind until Mecca was conquered — in charge of them the Prophet s placed ‘Attāb b. Asīd who proceeded to seek justice for the wronged from those that had wronged them.
Women,4,76,Those who believe do battle for the cause of Allah; and those who disbelieve do battle for the cause of idols. So fight the minions of the devil. Lo! the devil’s strategy is ever weak.,Those who believe fight in the way of God and those who disbelieve fight in the way of a false deity Satan. Fight therefore against the friends of Satan the supporters of his religion and you will defeat them with the strength you draw from God; surely the plotting of Satan against believers is ever feeble of no substance and cannot stand up to God’s plotting against the disbelievers.
Women,4,77,"Hast thou not seen those unto whom it was said: Withhold your hands, establish worship and pay the poordue, but when fighting was prescribed for them behold! a party of them fear mankind even as their fear of Allah or with greater fear, and say: Our Lord! Why hast Thou ordained fighting for us ? If only Thou wouldst give us respite yet a while! Say (unto them, O Muhammad): The comfort of this world is scant; the Hereafter will be better for him who wardeth off (evil); and ye will not be wronged the down upon a date-stone.",Have you not seen those to whom it was said ‘Restrain your hands from fighting the disbelievers when they desired it at Mecca because of the harm the disbelievers had inflicted upon them — and these were a group from among the Companions — and establish the prayer and pay the alms’? Then as soon as fighting was prescribed was made obligatory for them lo a party of them fear people the disbelievers that is they fear punishment at their hands through death as they would fear the punishment of God or with more fear than their fear of Him ashadda ‘more’ is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier; the response to the lammā ‘as soon as’ is indicated by idhā ‘lo’ and what follows in other words they are taken aback by fear and they said frightened of death ‘Our Lord why have You prescribed fighting for us? Why not lawlā is to be understood as hallā defer us to a near term?’ Say to them ‘The enjoyment of this world that which is enjoyed therein or enjoying it the world is trifling it will end up by perishing; and the Hereafter Paradise is better for him who fears God’s punishment by avoiding disobedience to Him; and you shall not be wronged lā tuzlamūna may also be read lā yuzlamūna ‘they shall not be wronged’ you shall not be diminished of your deeds a single date-thread as much as the peel on a date-stone so struggle in the way of God.
Women,4,78,"Wheresoever ye may be, death will overtake you, even though ye were in lofty towers. Yet if a happy thing befalleth them they say: This is from Allah; and if an evil thing befalleth them they say: This is of thy doing (O Muhammad). Say (unto them): All is from Allah. What is amiss with these people that they come not nigh to understand a happening ?",Wherever you may be death will overtake you though you should be in raised-up lofty towers’ forts so do not shrink from fighting for fear of death. And if a good thing such as fertility and abundance befalls them the Jews they say ‘This is from God’; but if an evil thing such as drought or misfortune befalls them as it did with them when the Prophet s arrived in Medina they say ‘This is from you’ O Muhammad (s) that is from the bad luck you bring. Say to them ‘Everything good and evil is from God.’ What is wrong with this people that they do not understand that is they do not come close to comprehending any words delivered to them the mā ‘what’ of mā li-hā’ūlā’ ‘what is wrong with these’ is an interrogative intended to provoke amazement at their extreme ignorance; to state that one cannot even come close to doing something is rhetorically more intense than saying that he cannot do it.
Women,4,79,"Whatever of good befalleth thee (O man) it is from Allah, and whatever of ill befalleth thee it is from thyself. We have sent thee (Muhammad) as a messenger unto mankind and Allah is sufficient as Witness.",Whatever good hasana means khayr befalls you O man it is from God it has come to you from His bounty; whatever evil misfortune befalls you is from yourself it has come to you as a necessary consequence of sins you have committed. We have sent you O Muhammad (s) to people as a messenger rasūlan is a circumstantial qualifier for emphasis and God suffices as Witness of your Mission.
Women,4,80,"Whoso obeyeth the messenger hath obeyed Allah, and whoso turneth away: We have not sent thee as a warder over them.",Whoever obeys the Messenger verily obeys God; and whoever turns his back whoever avoids obedience to you do not be concerned with them We have not sent you as a watcher over them to keep watch over their deeds but as a warner. Their affair is Ours to deal with and We will requite them. This statement was before the command to fight them was revealed.
Women,4,81,And they say: (It is) obedience; but when they have gone forth from thee a party of them spend the night in planning other than what thou sayest. Allah recordeth what they plan by night. So oppose them and put thy trust in Allah. Allah is sufficient as Trustee.,They say that is the hypocrites say when they come to you ‘Our affair is all about Obedience to you’; but when they sally forth when they depart from you a party of them harbour the final tā’ of the feminine-ending in bayyatat ‘harbour’ can either be elided with the following tā’ of tā’ifa ‘a party’ or simply omitted they entertain secretly feelings other than what they say to you in your presence in the way of their obedience in other words they hide disobedience to you. God writes down He commands that it be written what they harbour in their scrolls of deeds so that they will be requited for it. So turn away from them in forgiveness rely on God put your trust in Him for He will suffice you; and God suffices as a Guardian to Whom matters are entrusted.
Women,4,82,Will they not then ponder on the Qur’an ? If it had been from other than Allah they would have found therein much incongruity.,What do they not ponder do they not contemplate the Qur’ān? and the marvellous truths contained in it. If it had been from other than God surely they would have found therein much inconsistency much contradiction in meaning and irregularity in arrangement.
Women,4,83,"And if any tidings, whether of safety or fear, come unto them, they noise it abroad, whereas if they had referred it to the messenger and to such of them as are in authority, those among them who are able to think out the matter would have known it. If it had not been for the grace of Allah upon you and His mercy ye would have followed Satan, save a few (of you).",And when there comes to them an issue news concerning the raiding parties sent by the Prophet s and what has happened to them be it of security through victory or of fear through defeat they broadcast it they make it widely-known this was revealed regarding a group from among the hypocrites or from among the feeble believers who used to do this and so the hearts of the believers would lose courage and the Prophet s would become distressed. If they had referred it the news to the Messenger and to those in authority among them that is the judicious elders among the Companions in other words if they had kept quiet about it until they were fully informed; those among them who are able to think it out those who follow it up and seek knowledge of it the ones who broadcast it would have known it and whether it is a matter that ought be broadcast or not from them from the Prophet s and those of authority. And but for the bounty of God to you through Islam and His mercy to you through the Qur’ān you would surely have followed Satan in the abominations to which he commands you except a few of you.
Women,4,84,So fight (O Muhammad) in the way of Allah Thou art not taxed (with the responsibility for anyone) except thyself - and urge on the believers. Peradventure Allah will restrain the might of those who disbelieve. Allah is stronger in might and stronger in inflicting punishment.,So fight O Muhammad (s) in the way of God; you are charged only with yourself so do not be concerned with their failing to join you the meaning being fight even if you are on your own for you have been promised victory. And urge on the believers incite them to fight and make them desire it; maybe God will restrain the might the war of the disbelievers; God is mightier than them and more severe in castigation in punishment than them. And so the Messenger of God s said ‘By Him in Whose Hand is my soul I shall sally forth to fight even if I go alone’. Thereupon he sallied forth with seventy cavalrymen to the first battle at Badr where God restrained the might of the disbelievers by casting terror into their hearts and preventing Abū Sufyān from sallying forth as has already been mentioned in sūrat Āl ‘Imrān Q. 3151.
Women,4,85,"Whoso interveneth in a good cause will have the reward thereof, and whoso interveneth in an evil cause will bear the consequence thereof. Allah overseeth all things.",Whoever intercedes between people with a good intercession one in accordance with the Law shall receive a share of the reward for it because of it; and whoever intercedes with an evil intercession one in contravention of it the Law shall receive the like the share of the sin from it because of it. God conserves He has power over all things and so requites every person according to his deeds.
Women,4,86,"When ye are greeted with a greeting, greet ye with a better than it or return it. Lo! Allah taketh count of all things.",And when you are greeted with a greeting as when it is said to you ‘Peace be upon you’ greet the one that greeted you with better than it by responding to him with ‘Peace be upon you and God’s mercy and blessings’ or return it by saying back to him what he said; in other words it is a duty to greet in one of these two ways the former being the preferred one. Surely God keeps count of He holds you accountable for all things and requites accordingly including things such as returning a greeting. The Sunna specifies that one should not return the greeting of an disbeliever an innovator a wicked person and of the one that greets a person who is in the act of relieving himself or one in the bath or one eating — indeed it is actually disapproved with the exception of the last. To the disbeliever who says ‘peace be upon you’ one should simply say ‘And upon you’.
Women,4,87,Allah! There is no God save Him. He gathereth you all unto a Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt. Who is more true in statement than Allah ?,God — there is no god except Him and by God He will surely gather you from your graves to on the Day of Resurrection whereof there is no doubt no uncertainty. And who is truer in statement in speech than God? that is no one is.
Women,4,88,"What aileth you that ye are become two parties regarding the hypocrites, when Allah cast them back (to disbelief) because of what they earned ? Seek ye to guide him whom Allah hath sent astray ? He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him thou (O MUhammad) canst not find a road.",When a group retreated from Uhud people were at variance over their status. Some said ‘Let us slay them’ while others said ‘No!’ So the following was revealed What is wrong with you what is the matter with you that you have become two parties two groups regarding the hypocrites when God has overthrown them He has turned them back to disbelief for what they earned? in the way of disbelief and acts of disobedience. What do you desire to guide him whom God has sent astray? that is to count them among the guided the interrogative in both places is for disapproval. And he whom God sends astray you will never find for him a way a path to guidance.
Women,4,89,"They long that ye should disbelieve even as they disbelieve, that ye may be upon a level (with them). So choose not friends from them till they forsake their homes in the way of Allah; if they turn back (to enmity) then take them and kill them wherever ye find them, and choose no friend nor helper from among them,",They long they wish that you should disbelieve as they disbelieve so then you and they would be equal in unbelief; therefore do not take friends from among them associating with them even if they should outwardly manifest belief until they emigrate in the way of God a proper emigration that would confirm their belief; then if they turn away and remain upon their ways take them as captives and slay them wherever you find them; and do not take any of them as a patron to associate with or as a helper to assist you against your enemy.
Women,4,90,"Except those who seek refuge with a people between whom and you there is a covenant, or (those who) come unto you because their hearts forbid them to make war on you or make war on their own folk. Had Allah willed He could have given them power over you so that assuredly they would have fought you. So, if they hold aloof from you and wage not war against you and offer you peace, Allah alloweth you no way against them.",Except those who attach themselves to who seek refuge with a people between whom and you there is a covenant a pledge of security for them and for whoever attaches himself to them in the manner of the Prophet’s s covenant with Hilāl b. ‘Uwaymir al-Aslamī; or those who come to you with their breasts constricted dejected about the prospect of fighting you being on the side of their people or fighting their people siding with you in other words those who come to you refraining from fighting either you or them then do not interfere with them neither taking them as captives nor slaying them this statement and what follows was abrogated by the ‘sword’ verse. Had God willed to give them sway over you He would have given them sway over you by strengthening their hearts so that assuredly they would have fought you but God did not will it and so He cast terror into their hearts. And so if they stay away from you and do not fight you and offer you peace reconciliation that is if they submit then God does not allow you any way against them He does not allow you a means to take them captive or to slay them.
Women,4,91,"Ye will find others who desire that they should have security from you, and security from their own folk. So often as they are returned to hostility they are plunged therein. If they keep not aloof from you nor offer you peace nor hold their hands, then take them and kill them wherever ye find them. Against such We have given you clear warrant.",You will find others desiring to have security from you by manifesting belief before you and security from their own people through unbelief when they return to them and these were the tribes of Asad and Ghatafān; yet whenever they are returned to sedition whenever they are summoned to idolatry they are overwhelmed by it falling into it in the worst of ways. So if they do not stay away from you by refraining from fighting you and do not offer you peace and do not restrain their hands from you then take them as captives and slay them wherever you come upon them wherever you find them; against them We have given you clear warrant a clear and manifest proof for you to slay them and capture them on account of their treachery.
Women,4,92,"It is not for a believer to kill a believer unless (it be) by mistake. He who hath killed a believer by mistake must set free a believing slave, and pay the blood-money to the family of the slain, unless they remit it as a charity. If he (the victim) be of a people hostile unto you, and he is a believer, then (the penance is) to set free a believing slave. And if he cometh of a folk between whom and you there is a covenant, then the blood-money must be paid unto his folk and (also) a believing slave must be set free. And whoso hath not the wherewithal must fast two consecutive months. A penance from Allah. Allah is Knower, Wise.",It is not for a believer to slay a believer in other words no such slaying should result at his hands except by mistake killing him by mistake unintentionally. He who slays a believer by mistake when he meant to strike some other thing as in the case of hunting or shooting at trees but then happens to strike him with what in most cases would not kill then let him set free let him emancipate a believing slave raqaba denotes nasama ‘a person’ an obligation on him and blood-money is to be submitted to be paid to his family that is the slain person’s inheritors unless they remit it as a charity to him by waiving their claim to it. In the Sunna this blood-money is explained as being equivalent to one hundred camels twenty pregnant twenty female sucklings twenty male sucklings twenty mature ones and twenty young ones not more than five years old; and the Sunna stipulates that it is incumbent upon the killer’s clan namely his paternal relations and not other relatives. They share this burden of the blood-money over three years; the rich among them pays half a dinar while the one of moderate means pays a quarter of a dinar each year; if they still cannot meet this then it can be taken from the treasury and if this is not possible then from the killer himself. If he the slain belongs to a people at enmity at war with you and is a believer then the setting free of a believing slave is incumbent upon the slayer as a redemption but no bloodmoney is to be paid to his family since they are at war with you. If he the slain belongs to a people between whom and you there is a covenant a treaty as is the case with the Protected People ahl al-dhimma then the blood-money for him must be paid to his family and it constitutes a third of the blood-money for a believer if the slain be a Jew or a Christian and two thirds of a tenth of it if he be a Magian; and the setting free of a believing slave is incumbent upon the slayer. But if he has not the wherewithal for setting free a slave failing to find one or the means to obtain one then the fasting of two successive months is incumbent upon him as a redemption here God does not mention the transition to an alternative to fasting which is giving food to the needy as in the case of repudiating one’s wife by zihār something which al-Shāfi‘ī advocates in the more correct of two opinions of his; a relenting from God tawbatan ‘relenting’ is the verbal noun and is in the accusative because of the implied verb.
Women,4,93,"Whoso slayeth a believer of set purpose, his reward is hell for ever. Allah is wroth against him and He hath cursed him and prepared for him an awful doom.",And whoever slays a believer deliberately intending to kill him with something that is lethal aware of the fact that he the slain is a believer his requital is Hell abiding therein and God is wroth with him and has cursed him He has removed him from His mercy and has prepared for him a mighty chastisement in the Fire this may be explained as referring to the person that deems such killing licit or as being his requital if he were to be requited but it would not be anything new if this threat of punishment were to be forgone because of what He says Other than that that is idolatry He forgives whomever He will Q. 448. It is reported from Ibn ‘Abbās that it the verse should be understood as it stands abrogating other verses of ‘forgiveness’. The verse in sūrat al-Baqara Q. 2178 clearly indicates that the one who kills deliberately should be killed in return or if he is pardoned then he has to pay the blood-money the value of which has already been mentioned. It is made clear in the Sunna that between the intentional and the unintentional there is a type of killing that is identified as being with quasi-deliberate intent shibh al-‘amd where the killer has slain with what in most cases is not a lethal implement. In such a case there is no right to retaliation and blood-money is paid instead so that it this type of killing is described as intentional but considered unintentional in that there applies the fixing of the period for payment and the sharing of the burden by the killer’s clan; in this case and that of intentional killing redemption is more urgent than in unintentional killing.
Women,4,94,"O ye who believe! When ye go forth (to fight) in the way of Allah, be careful to discriminate, and say not unto one who offereth you peace: ""Thou art not a believer,"" seeking the chance profits of this life (so that ye may despoil him). With Allah are plenteous spoils. Even thus (as he now is) were ye before; but Allah hath since then been gracious unto you. Therefore take care to discriminate. Allah is ever Informed of what ye do.",The following was revealed when a group from among the Companions passed by a man from the Banū Sulaym driving his flock of sheep and he offered them a greeting of peace. But they said ‘He only greeted us dissimulating out of fear’. So they killed him and took away his flock O you who believe when you are going forth travelling in order to struggle in the way of God be discriminating fa-tabayyanū; a variant reading has fa-tathabbatū ‘ascertain’ here and further below; and do not say to him who offers you peace read al-salām or al-salam that is the greeting or offers you submission declaring the profession of faith shahāda which is an indication of being a Muslim ‘You are not a believer you are only saying this to dissimulate for fear of your life and property’ so that you then end up killing him desiring seeking by this the transient goods of the life of this world that is its enjoyment in the way of spoils. With God are plenteous spoils rendering you free of the need to kill such a person for his property. So you were formerly when your lives and property were protected simply upon your professing the faith; but God has been gracious to you making you known for your faith and uprightness. So be discriminating lest you kill a believer and treat those entering the religion as you were treated formerly. Surely God is ever Aware of what you do and will requite you for it.
Women,4,95,"Those of the believers who sit still, other than those who have a (disabling) hurt, are not on an equality with those who strive in the way of Allah with their wealth and lives. Allah hath conferred on those who strive with their wealth and lives a rank above the sedentary. Unto each Allah hath promised good, but He hath bestowed on those who strive a great reward above the sedentary;",The believers who sit at home away from the struggle other than those who have an injury such as a chronic illness or blindness or the like read in the nominative ghayru ūlī l-darar ‘other than those who have an injury’ as an adjectival clause; or in the accusative ghayra ūlī l-darar as an exceptive clause are not the equals of those who struggle in the way of God with their possessions and their lives. God has preferred those who struggle with their possessions and their lives over the ones who sit at home on account of some injury by a degree by a degree of merit since both have the same intention but the extra degree is given to those who have carried out the struggle; yet to each of the two groups God has promised the goodly reward Paradise and God has preferred those who struggle over the ones who sit at home without any injury with a great reward ajran ‘azīman is substituted by the following darajātin minhu
Women,4,96,"Degrees of rank from Him, and forgiveness and mercy. Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.",degrees that is stations one higher than the other in honour from Him and forgiveness and mercy maghfiratan and rahmatan are in the accusative because they constitute an object of the implied verb faddala ‘He has preferred’. Surely God is ever Forgiving to His friends Merciful to those that obey Him.
Women,4,97,"Lo! as for those whom the angels take (in death) while they wrong themselves, (the angels) will ask: In what were ye engaged ? They will say: We were oppressed in the land. (The angels) will say: Was not Allah’s earth spacious that ye could have migrated therein ? As for such, their habitation will be hell, an evil journey’s end;",The following was revealed regarding a group of people who submitted to Islam but did not emigrate and were then slain in the battle of Badr alongside the disbelievers And those whom the angels take in death while they are wronging their souls having remained among the disbelievers and neglected to emigrate the angels will say to them in rebuke ‘What was your predicament?’ in other words ‘in what circumstances were you with regard to your religion’. They will say giving excuses ‘We were oppressed unable to establish religion in the land’ the land of Mecca. The angels will say to them in rebuke ‘But was not God’s earth spacious that you might have emigrated therein?’ from the land of unbelief to another land as others did? God exalted be He says as for such their abode shall be Hell — an evil journey’s end it is!
Women,4,98,"Except the feeble among men, and the women, and the children, who are unable to devise a plan and are not shown a way.",Except the oppressed among the men women and children who are unable to devise a plan having no strength to emigrate and no substance and are not guided to a way a means of going to the land of emigration.
Women,4,99,"As for such, it may be that Allah will pardon them. Allah is ever Clement, Forgiving.",As for such perhaps God will pardon them for God is ever Pardoning Forgiving.
Women,4,100,"Whoso migrateth for the cause of Allah will find much refuge and abundance in the earth, and whoso forsaketh his home, a fugitive unto Allah and His messenger, and death overtaketh him, his reward is then incumbent on Allah. Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.",Whoever emigrates in the way of God will find in the earth many refuges places of emigration and abundance of provision; whoever goes forth from his house as an emigrant to God and His Messenger and then death overtakes him along the way as occurred with Junda‘ or Jundab b. Damra al-Laythī his wage is then incumbent upon fixed with God; surely God is ever Forgiving Merciful.
Women,4,101,"And when ye go forth in the land, it is no sin for you to curtail (your) worship if ye fear that those who disbelieve may attack you. In truth the disbelievers are an open enemy to you.",And when you are going forth travelling in the land you would not be at fault if you shorten the prayer by making it two genuflexions instead of four if you fear that you may be afflicted by those who do not believe that is if you fear that you may be harmed by them this fear of affliction at the hands of the disbelievers is just intended as an explication of the reality of the situation at that time and the point no longer applies. In the Sunna it is pointed out that ‘travel’ safar means long-distance travel which is approximately 50 miles. God’s words ‘you would not be at fault’ should be understood as denoting a dispensation and not a requirement and this is the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī; the disbelievers are a manifest foe to you their enmity being evident.
Women,4,102,"And when thou (O Muhammad) art among them and arrangest (their) worship for them, let only a party of them stand with thee (to worship) and let them take their arms. Then when they have performed their prostrations let them fall to the rear and let another party come that hath not worshipped and let them worship with thee, and let them take their precaution and their arms. Those who disbelieve long for you to neglect your arms and your baggage that they may attack you once for all. It is no sin for you to lay aside your arms, if rain impedeth you or ye are sick. But take your precaution. Lo! Allah prepareth for the disbelievers shameful punishment.",When you O Muhammad (s) are present among them while you all fear an enemy and you stand to lead them in prayer this type of address is customary in the Qur’ān let a party of them stand with you while another party stand back and let them the party standing with you take their weapons with them. Then when they have performed their prostrations that is when they have prayed let them the other party be behind you on guard until you complete the prayers; thereupon let this party go on guard and let another party who have not prayed come and pray with you taking their precautions and their weapons with them until you have completed the prayers. The Prophet s did this once at Batn Nakhla as reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim. The disbelievers wish when you have stood up to pray that you should be heedless of your weapons and your baggage that they may descend upon you all at once by making an assault against you and capturing you and herein is the reasoning behind keeping weapons on oneself. You are not at fault if rain bothers you or if you are sick to lay aside your weapons and not carry them this implies that when there is no such excuse it is compulsory to carry them and this is one of two opinions held by al-Shāfi‘ī on this matter; the other opinion is that this precaution constitutes a sunna and this is the more preferable opinion. But take your precautions against the enemy and be on your guard as best you can; God has prepared for the disbelievers a humiliating chastisement.
Women,4,103,"When ye have performed the act of worship, remember Allah, standing, sitting and reclining. And when ye are in safety, observe proper worship. Worship at fixed times hath been enjoined on the believers.",When you have performed the prayer when you have completed it remember God by repeating ‘There is no god but God’ tahlīl and ‘Glory be to God’ tasbīh standing and sitting and on your sides lying down in other words in all states. Then when you are reassured when you are secure observe the prayer perform it with its proper due surely the prayer is for believers a prescription enjoined that is an obligation at specific times that is its appointed times are set and so it should not be postponed from these times.
Women,4,104,"Relent not in pursuit of the enemy. If ye are suffering, lo! they suffer even as ye suffer and ye hope from Allah that for which they cannot hope. Allah is ever Knower, Wise.",After they returned from Uhud the Prophet s dispatched a group to seek out Abū Sufyān and his companions but they complained about their wounds and the following was revealed Be not faint be not weak in seeking in pursuing the enemy the disbelievers in order to fight them; if you are suffering if you have pains from a wound they are also suffering as you are suffering that is just like you yet they do not shrink from fighting you; and you hope from God in the way of victory and the reward for it that for which they cannot hope and since you have this advantage over them you should be more willing for it than them. God is ever Knower of all things Wise in His actions.
Women,4,105,"Lo! We reveal unto thee the Scripture with the truth, that thou mayst judge between mankind by that which Allah showeth thee. And be not thou a pleader for the treacherous;",Tu‘ma b. Ubayriq stole a coat of mail and hid it with a Jew. When it was discovered with the latter Tu‘ma accused him of having stolen it and swore by God that he Tu‘ma had not stolen it and his clan asked the Prophet s to advocate on his behalf and absolve him whereupon the following was revealed Surely We have revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān with the truth bi’l-haqq is semantically connected to anzalnā ‘We have revealed’ so that you may judge between people by that which God has shown you what God has taught you. And do not be a disputant for traitors like Tu‘ma disputing on their behalf.
Women,4,106,"And seek forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.",And pray for forgiveness from God for that which you considered doing; surely God is ever Forgiving Merciful.
Women,4,107,And plead not on behalf of (people) who deceive themselves. Lo! Allah loveth not one who is treacherous and sinful.,And do not dispute on behalf of those who betray themselves through acts of disobedience for the evil consequences of their betrayal shall fall on them; surely God loves not one who is treacherous frequently betraying and sinful that is to say He will punish him.
Women,4,108,They seek to hide from men and seek not to hide from Allah. He is with them when by night they hold discourse displeasing unto Him. Allah ever surroundeth what they do.,They the likes of Tu‘ma and his clan hide themselves in shame from people but they do not hide themselves from God; for He is with them in His knowledge of them while they plot they conspire at night with discourse displeasing to Him in their resolve to swear by God and deny the theft and accuse the Jew of it. God is ever Encompassing in knowledge of what they do.
Women,4,109,"Ho! ye are they who pleaded for them in the life of the world. But who will plead with Allah for them on the Day of Resurrection, or who will then be their defender ?",Ah! There you are addressing Tu‘ma’s clan you have contested you have disputed on their behalf that is to say on behalf of Tu‘ma and his men a variant reading has ‘anhu ‘on his behalf’ in the life of this world; but who will contest against God on their behalf on the Day of Resurrection if He were to punish them or who will be a guardian for them and take charge of their affair or defend them? In other words no one will do such a thing.
Women,4,110,"Yet whoso doeth evil or wrongeth his own soul, then seeketh pardon of Allah, will find Allah Forgiving, Merciful.",Whoever does evil commits a sin by which another is harmed as when Tu‘ma falsely accused the Jew or wrongs himself committing a sin the consequences of which are limited to him and then prays for God’s forgiveness for it that is to say and then he repents he shall find God is Forgiving Merciful to him.
Women,4,111,"Whoso committeth sin committeth it only against himself. Allah is ever Knower, Wise.",And whoever commits a sin commits it against himself only since the evil consequences fall on him harming no one else; and God is ever Knower Wise in His actions.
Women,4,112,"And whoso committeth a delinquency or crime, then throweth (the blame) thereof upon the innocent, hath burdened himself with falsehood and a flagrant crime.",And whoever commits a mistake a minor sin or a sin a grave sin and then casts it upon the innocent one who is innocent of it he has thereby burdened himself with calumny by his false accusation and a manifest sin one which is evident on account of what he has committed.
Women,4,113,"But for the grace of Allah upon thee (Muhammad), and His mercy, a party of them had resolved to mislead thee, but they will mislead only themselves and they will hurt thee not at all. Allah revealeth unto thee the Scripture and wisdom, and teacheth thee that which thou knewest not. The grace of Allah toward thee hath been infinite.",Were it not for God’s bounty to you O Muhammad (s) and His mercy by way of protecting you a party of them of Tu‘ma’s clan would have intended would have conspired to lead you astray from judging with truth by deceiving you; but they lead only themselves astray; they will not hurt you at all since the evil consequence of their leading you astray would have fallen on them. God has revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān and wisdom the rulings contained therein and He has taught you what you did not know of rulings and the Unseen; and God’s bounty to you in this and other respects is ever great.
Women,4,114,"There is no good in much of their secret conferences save (in) him who enjoineth almsgiving and kindness and peace-making among the people. Whoso doeth that, seeking the good pleasure of Allah, We shall bestow on him a vast reward.",There is no good in much of their that is of people’s secret conversations that is what they converse and talk secretly about except for the secret talk of he who enjoins to voluntary almsgiving or kindness a righteous deed or setting things right between people. And whoever does that the aforementioned desiring seeking God’s good pleasure and nothing else of the affairs of this world We shall surely give him read nu’tīhi or yu’tīhi ‘He will give him’ that is ‘God will give him’ a great wage.
Women,4,115,"And whoso opposeth the messenger after the guidance (of Allah) hath been manifested unto him, and followeth other than the believer’s way, We appoint for him that unto which he himself hath turned, and expose him unto hell - a hapless journey’s end!",But whoever makes a breach with whoever opposes the Messenger in the truth that he brings after guidance has become clear to him after the truth has become manifest to him through miracles and follows a path other than the way of the believers that is to say other than the path they follow in religion by disbelieving We shall turn him over to what he has turned to We shall make him a leader of the misguidance which he has followed by leaving this as it is between them in this world and We shall expose him We shall admit him in the Hereafter in Hell where he will burn — an evil journey’s end an evil return it is.
Women,4,116,Lo! Allah pardoneth not that partners should be ascribed unto Him. He pardoneth all save that to whom He will. Whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah hath wandered far astray.,God does not forgive that anything should be associated with Him; He forgives all except that to whomever He will. Whoever associates anything with God verily he has strayed far away from the truth.
Women,4,117,"They invoke in His stead only females; they pray to none else than Satan, a rebel",What in is to be understand as mā ‘only’ they pray to what the idolaters worship instead of Him God that is other than Him are but females idols with feminine names such as al-Lāt al-‘Uzza and Manāt; and they in is to be understand as mā ‘only’ only pray to they only worship by worshipping these female idols a rebellious satan one who has rebelled against obedience to God for they are obeying him in this worship of female idols.
Women,4,118,"Whom Allah cursed, and he said: Surely I will take of Thy bondmen an appointed portion,",God has cursed him He has removed him from His mercy. And he namely Satan said ‘Assuredly I will take to myself I will appoint for myself an appointed portion an apportioned share of Your servants whom I shall call to obey me.
Women,4,119,"And surely I will lead them astray, and surely I will arouse desires in them, and surely I will command them and they will cut the cattle’ ears, and surely I will command them and they will change Allah’s creation.

And surely I will command them and they will change God’s creation’ substituting His religion with unbelief making lawful what God has made unlawful and making unlawful what God has made lawful. And whoever takes Satan for a patron following him and obeying him instead of God has surely suffered a manifest loss one that is evident since he will end up in the Fire made perpetual for him.
Women,4,120,"He promiseth them and stirreth up desires in them, and Satan promiseth them only to beguile.",He promises them long life and fills them with desires of attaining their hopes in this world and that there will be neither resurrection nor requital; but what Satan promises them therewith is only delusion falsehood.

He who doeth wrong will have the recompense thereof, and will not find against Allah any protecting friend or helper.",When the Muslims and the People of the Scripture began to pride themselves upon God’s promise the following was revealed It this matter is not dependent upon your desires nor the desires of the People of the Scripture but upon righteous deeds. Whoever does evil shall be requited for it either in the Hereafter or in this life through trials and tribulations as is stated in hadīth; and he will not find besides God that is other than Him any friend to protect him or helper to defend him against Him.

Women,4,125,"Who is better in religion than he who surrendereth his purpose to Allah while doing good (to men) and followeth the tradition of Abraham, the upright ? Allah (Himself) chose Abraham for friend.",And who that is and none is fairer in religion than he who submits his purpose that is than he who is compliant and offers his deeds sincerely to God and is virtuous and declares God’s Oneness and who follows the creed of Abraham the one that is in accordance with the creed of Islam as a hanīf? hanīfan is a circumstantial qualifier that is to say one inclining away from all religions to the upright religion. And God took Abraham for a close friend as His elect one whose love for Him is pure.
Women,4,126,Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and whatsoever is in the earth. Allah ever surroundeth all things.,To God belongs all that is in the heavens and in the earth as possessions creatures and servants; and God is ever the Encompasser of all things in knowledge and power that is He is ever possessed of such attributes.
Women,4,127,"They consult thee concerning women.

Say to them ‘God pronounces to you concerning them and what is recited to you in the Book the Qur’ān in the ‘inheritance’ verse Q. 411 and He also pronounces to you concerning the orphan women to whom you do not give what is prescribed what is obligatory for them of inheritance for you O guardians who desire not to marry them because of their ugliness and you prevent them from marrying others coveting their inheritance in other words God pronounces to you not to do this; and concerning the oppressed young children that you give them what is their due and He also commands you that you deal justly equitably with orphans with respect to inheritance and dowry. Whatever good you do God is ever Knower of it’ and He will requite you for it.
Women,4,128,"If a woman feareth ill treatment from her husband, or desertion, it is no sin for them twain if they make terms of peace between themselves. Peace is better.

God exalted be He in explaining the natural disposition of man says But greed has been made present in the souls al-shuhh is extreme niggardliness meaning that they have a natural propensity for this as if they the souls are ever in its presence never absent from it. The meaning is a woman would scarcely allow another to share her husband with her and a man would scarcely allow her to enjoy him if he were to fall in love with another. If you are virtuous in your conjugal life with women and fear being unjust to them surely God is ever aware of what you do and He will requite you for it.
Women,4,129,"Ye will not be able to deal equally between (your) wives, however much ye wish (to do so). But turn not altogether away (from one), leaving her as in suspense. If ye do good and keep from evil, lo! Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.",You will never be able to be just to to treat equally your wives in terms of love even if you be eager for this; yet do not turn altogether away towards the one you love with respect to the shares and maintenance expenses so that you leave her the one from whom you turn away like one suspended one that is neither a slavegirl nor a woman with a husband. If you set things right by being just with the shares and fear injustice surely God is ever Forgiving regarding the inclination in your hearts Merciful to you in this respect.
Women,4,130,"But if they separate, Allah will compensate each out of His abundance. Allah is ever All-Embracing, All-Knowing.",But if they the married couple separate by way of divorce God will compensate each of them from the need of the other out of His plenty that is out of His bounty by giving her another as husband and giving him another as wife. God is ever Embracing of His creatures in bounty Wise in what He has ordained for them.

So give us from the booty; but if the disbelievers have some luck by gaining a victory over you they say to them ‘Did we not gain mastery authority over you capable of capturing you and slaying you but we spared you and did we not defend you against the believers?’ lest they be victorious over you by forsaking them and apprising you of their plans and thus have we not done you a favour?

And We bestowed on Moses evident authority.",The People of the Scripture the Jews will ask of you O Muhammad (s) to cause a Book to be revealed to them from the heaven all at once as was revealed to Moses merely to harass you. If you consider this shocking then know that they their forefathers asked Moses for something greater than that for they said ‘Show us God openly’ before our eyes; so the thunderbolt death seized them as punishment for them for their evildoing when they harassed him Moses with this demand. They then took to themselves the golden calf for a god after clear proofs the miracles testifying to God’s Oneness had come to them; yet We pardoned that and did not annihilate them; and We bestowed upon Moses clear authority evident and manifest sway over them for when he commanded them to slay themselves in repentance they obeyed him.

Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.",Forbidden to you is carrion that is the consumption of it and blood that is what has been spilt as mentioned in sūrat al-An‘ām Q. 6145 and the flesh of swine and what has been hallowed to other than God in that it was sacrificed in the name of something other than Him and the beast strangled to death and the beast beaten down to death and the beast fallen from a height to its death and the beast gored to death by another and what beasts of prey have devoured of such animals — except for what you have sacrificed duly catching it while it still breathes life and then sacrificing it — and what has been sacrificed in the name of idols nusub is the plural of nusāb and that you apportion that is that you demand an oath or a ruling through the divining of arrows azlām the plural of zalam or zulam which is a qidh ‘a small arrow’ without feathers or a head. There were seven of these arrows marked with flags and they were retained by the keeper of the Ka‘ba. They would use them for abitrations and when they commanded them they obeyed and if they prohibited them they would desist; that is wickedness a rebellion against obedience. And on the Day of ‘Arafa in the year of the Farewell Pilgrimage the following was revealed Today the disbelievers have despaired of your religion of you apostatising from it having hoped for it earlier for now they perceived its strength; therefore do not fear them but fear Me. Today I have perfected your religion for you that is its rulings and obligations after this verse nothing about what is lawful or unlawful was revealed and I have completed My favour upon you by perfecting it your religion but it is also said by effecting their safe entry into Mecca; and I have approved chosen Islam for you as religion. But whoever is constrained by emptiness by hunger to consume some of what has been forbidden him and consumes it not inclining purposely to sin to an act of disobedience — then God is Forgiving to him for what he has consumed Merciful to him by permitting it to him in contrast to the one who purposely inclines to sin that is the one actively engaged in it such as a waylayer or a criminal for whom such consumption is forbidden.
The Table Spread,5,4,"They ask thee (O Muhammad) what is made lawful for them. Say: (all) good things are made lawful for you. And those beasts and birds of prey which ye have trained as hounds are trained, ye teach them that which Allah taught you; so eat of that which they catch for you and mention Allah’s name upon it, and observe your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is swift to take account.",They will ask you O Muhammad (s) about what food is made lawful for them. Say ‘The good delicious things are made lawful for you; and the quarry of hunting creatures dogs wildcats or birds that catch food you have taught training them as hounds mukallibīn is a circumstantial qualifier derived from kallabtu al-kalba meaning ‘I released the hound against the quarry’ teaching them tu‘allimūnahunna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of mukallibīn ‘training them as hounds’ in other words ‘disciplining them’ of what God has taught you of the art of hunting; so eat what they have caught for you even if they have killed it as long as they have not eaten any of it. This is in contrast to the untrained hunting creatures whose catch is not lawful for consumption the mark of these being trained hunting creatures is that they should return after they have been sent out that they can be curbed when cried at and that they can seize the quarry without eating of it; the minimum number of times by which this may be known is three. If they eat any of it then it cannot be counted as ‘what they have caught’ for their trainers and is consequently unlawful for consumption as reported in hadīth in both of the Sahīhs of Bukhārī and Muslim — therein it is also mentioned that a catch made by an arrow over which God’s name is mentioned is equivalent in lawfulness to the catch of trained hunting creatures. And mention God’s name over it when you unleash it. And fear God. Indeed God is swift at the reckoning’.
The Table Spread,5,5,"This day are (all) good things made lawful for you. The food of those who have received the Scripture is lawful for you, and your food is lawful for them. And so are the virtuous women of the believers and the virtuous women of those who received the Scripture before you (lawful for you) when ye give them their marriage portions and live with them in honour, not in fornication, nor taking them as secret concubines. Whoso denieth the faith, his work is vain and he will be among the losers in the Hereafter.",Today the good the delicious things are permitted to you and the food of those who were given the Scripture that is animals slaughtered by the Jews and Christians is permitted to you and permitted to them is your food. Likewise the believing free married women and the married women of those who were given the Scripture before you are permitted to you for marriage if you give them their wages their dowries in wedlock in marriage and not illicitly fornicating overtly with them or taking them as lovers so as to fornicate with them secretly. Whoever disbelieves in faith that is whose apostatises his prior good work has indeed failed and so it counts for nothing and he will not be rewarded for it and in the Hereafter he shall be among the losers if he dies in this state of unbelief.
The Table Spread,5,6,"O ye who believe! When ye rise up for prayer, wash you faces, and your hands up to the elbows, and lightly rub your heads and (wash) your feet up to the ankles. And if ye are unclean, purify yourselves. And if ye are sick or on a journey, or one of you cometh from the closet, or ye have had contact with women, and ye find not water, then go to clean, high ground and rub your faces and your hands with some of it. Allah would not place a burden on you, but He would purify you and would perfect His grace upon you, that ye may give thanks.",O you who believe when you stand up that is when you intend to go to pray and you are in a state of ritual impurity wash your faces and your hands up to the elbows that is including them the elbows as is clarified in the Sunna; and wipe your heads the bā’ in bi-ru’ūsikum is for ‘adherence’ that is to say wipe over the head adhering the hand closely without excessive water pouring over; the noun ra’s ‘head’ is generic and so the minimum required to fulfil the stipulation is acceptable which is the wiping of some of the hair as al-Shāfi‘ī asserts; and your feet read wa-arjulakum in the accusative as a supplement to aydīyakum; or wa-arjulikum in the genitive because of its adjacency to the genitive bi-ru’ūsikum up to the ankles that is including them the ankles as is clarified in the Sunna and they are the two protruding bones at the juncture of the legs and the feet. The interposing of the wiping of the head between the mention of the hands and the feet which are washed is intended to show the requirement of a specific order during the purification of these limbs as al-Shāfi‘ī asserts. In addition the requirement of making intention niyya in this ablution as in the other rituals of worship is taken from the Sunna. If you are defiled purify wash yourselves; but if you are sick with an illness made worse by water or on a journey travelling or if any of you comes from the privy that is if he has defecated or you have touched women as mentioned already in the verse in sūrat al-Nisā’ Q. 443 and you cannot find water having made the effort to look for it then head for seek wholesome dust that is clean earth and wipe your faces and your hands including the elbows with it using two strikes the bā’ of bi-wujūhikum ‘your faces’ denotes ‘adherence’; it is explained in the Sunna that the requirement here is for the wiping to encompass the whole of these two parts. God does not desire to make any hardship for you any constraint in the obligations He has imposed on you with regard to ablution washing and purification with dust; but He desires to purify you of filth and sins and that He may perfect His grace upon you through Islam by explaining the laws of the religion; so that you might give thanks for His graces.
The Table Spread,5,7,Remember Allah’s grace upon you and His covenant by which He bound you when ye said: We hear and we obey; And keep your duty to Allah. Lo! He knoweth what is in the breasts (of men).,And remember God’s grace upon you through Islam and His covenant His pledge which He made He bound with you when you said to the Prophet s upon pledging allegiance to him ‘We hear and we obey’ all that you command and forbid of what we love and what we despise. And fear God in His covenant lest you break it. Surely God knows what is in the breasts that is what is in the hearts of people all the more reason for Him to have knowledge of other things.
The Table Spread,5,8,"O ye who believe! Be steadfast witnesses for Allah in equity, and let not hatred of any people seduce you that ye deal not justly. Deal justly, that is nearer to your duty. Observe your duty to Allah. Lo! Allah is Informed of what ye do.",O you who believe be upright before God in fulfilling what is His due witnesses in equity in justice. Let not hatred of a people namely the disbelievers cause you not to be just and to harm them on account of their enmity; be just towards both friend and foe that justice is nearer to God-fearing. And fear God; surely God is aware of what you do and will requite you for it.
The Table Spread,5,9,Allah hath promised those who believe and do good works: Theirs will be forgiveness and immense reward.,God has promised those who believe and perform righteous deeds an excellent promise they shall have forgiveness and a great wage that is Paradise.
The Table Spread,5,10,"And they who disbelieve and deny Our revelations, such are rightful owners of hell.",And they who disbelieve and deny Our signs — they shall be the inhabitants of Hell-fire.
The Table Spread,5,11,"O ye who believe! Remember Allah’s favour unto you, how a people were minded to stretch out their hands against you but He withheld their hands from you; and keep your duty to Allah. In Allah let believers put their trust.",O you who believe remember God’s favour upon you when a people namely Quraysh purposed to extend their hands against you in order to attack you but He restrained their hands from you and protected you from what they intended to do to you; and fear God; and in God let the believers put their trust.
The Table Spread,5,12,"Allah made a covenant of old with the Children of Israel and We raised among them twelve chieftains, and Allah said: Lo! I am with you. If ye establish worship and pay the poor-due, and believe in My messengers and support them, and lend unto Allah a kindly loan, surely I shall remit your sins, and surely I shall bring you into Gardens underneath which rivers flow. Whoso among you disbelieveth after this will go astray from a plain road.",God had made a covenant with the Children of Israel for what will be mentioned shortly and We raised up there is a shift of address away from the third to the first person from among them twelve leaders from each tribe one leader to be responsible for his people’s fulfilment of the covenant as a way of binding them to it. And God said to them ‘I am with you helping and assisting. Surely if la-in the lām is for oaths you establish the prayer and pay the alms and believe in My messengers and succour them help them and lend to God a goodly loan by expending in His way I will absolve you of your evil deeds and I will admit you to gardens underneath which rivers flow. So whoever of you disbelieves after that covenant surely he has strayed from the right way’ he has erred from the path to Paradise al-sawā’ originally means ‘the middle way’. And they broke the covenant.
The Table Spread,5,13,"And because of their breaking their covenant, We have cursed them and made hard their hearts. They change words from their context and forget a part of that whereof they were admonished. Thou wilt not cease to discover treachery from all save a few of them. But bear with them and pardon them. Lo! Allah loveth the kindly.",God says So because bi-mā the mā is extra of their breaking their covenant We cursed them We removed them from Our mercy and made their hearts hard unyielding to the acceptance of faith; they pervert words pertaining to the descriptions of Muhammad (s) in the Torah and other things from their contexts those in which God has placed them in other words they substitute them; and they have forgotten they have abandoned a portion a part of what they were reminded of of what they were enjoined to in the Torah in the way of following Muhammad (s); and you — addressing the Prophet s now — will never cease to discover some treachery on their part in the way of breaking a covenant or some other matter except for a few of them who have submitted themselves to Islam. Yet pardon them and forgive; surely God loves the virtuous this was abrogated by the ‘sword’ verse Q. 95.
The Table Spread,5,14,"And with those who say: ""Lo! we are Christians,"" We made a covenant, but they forgot a part of that whereof they were admonished. Therefor We have stirred up enmity and hatred among them till the Day of Resurrection, when Allah will inform them of their handiwork.",And with those who say ‘We are Christians’ this is semantically connected to what follows We made a covenant just as We did with the Children of Israel the Jews and they have forgotten a portion of that they were reminded of in the Gospel pertaining to faith and other matters and they too broke the covenant. So We have stirred up We have caused among them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection on account of their schisms and differing whims each sect charging the other with unbelief; and God will assuredly tell them in the Hereafter of what they wrought and requite them for this.
The Table Spread,5,15,"O People of the Scripture! Now hath Our messenger come unto you, expounding unto you much of that which ye used to hide in the Scripture, and forgiving much. now hath come unto you light from Allah and plain Scripture,",O People of the Scripture Jews and Christians now there has come to you Our Messenger Muhammad (s) making clear to you much of what you used to conceal of the Scripture the Torah and the Gospel such as the ‘stoning’ verse and the description of the Prophet Muhammad (s) and pardoning much of it which he does not reveal since this would not be of any benefit serving only to disgrace you. There has verily come to you from God a light namely the Prophet s and a Book a Qur’ān lucid plain and manifest
The Table Spread,5,16,"Whereby Allah guideth him who seeketh His good pleasure unto paths of peace. He bringeth them out of darkness unto light by His decree, and guideth them unto a straight path.",whereby that is the Book by which God guides whoever follows His good pleasure by believing to the ways of peace the paths of safety and brings them forth from the shadows from unbelief into the light into belief by His leave by His will and He guides them to a straight path the religion of Islam.
The Table Spread,5,17,"They indeed have disbelieved who say: Lo! Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary. Say: Who then can do aught against Allah, if He had willed to destroy the Messiah son of Mary, and his mother and everyone on earth ? Allah’s is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. He createth what He will. And Allah is Able to do all things.",They indeed are disbelievers those who say ‘God is the Messiah son of Mary’ insofar as they make him Jesus a god and these were the Jacobites a Christian sect. Say ‘Who then can do anything who then can defend against the chastisement of God if He desires to destroy the Messiah son of Mary and his mother and all those who are on earth?’ that is to say none can do anything of the sort since if Jesus were a god he would be able to do so. And to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them. He creates what He will. God has power over everything which He wills.
The Table Spread,5,18,"The Jews and Christians say: We are sons of Allah and His loved ones. Say: Why then doth He chastise you for your sins ? Nay, ye are but mortals of His creating. He forgiveth whom He will, and chastiseth whom He will. Allah’s is the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, and unto Him is the journeying.",The Jews and Christians both of them say ‘We are the sons of God that is we are like his sons in terms of closeness and rank and He is like a father to us in terms of compassion and care and His beloved ones’. Say to them O Muhammad (s) ‘Why then does He chastise you for your sins? if what you say is true. For the father does not punish his son nor the loving his beloved; but He has punished you and therefore you are saying lies. Nay; you are mortals from among all those mortals He created you shall be rewarded as they are rewarded and you shall be requited as they are requited. He forgives him for whom He wills forgiveness and He chastises him for whom He wills’ chastisement and there can be no objection thereto. For to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth and all that is between them; to Him is the journey’s end the final return.
The Table Spread,5,19,"O People of the Scripture! Now hath Our messenger come unto you to make things plain unto you after an interval (of cessation) of the messengers, lest ye should say: There came not unto us a messenger of cheer nor any warner. Now hath a messenger of cheer and a warner come unto you. Allah is Able to do all things.",O People of the Scripture there has verily come to you Our Messenger Muhammad (s) making clear to you the laws of religion after an interval between the messengers for there was no messenger between him and Jesus an interval of 569 years; lest you should say if you are punished ‘There has not come to us any bearer of good tidings min bashīr the min is extra nor any warner’. Indeed there has come to you a bearer of good tidings and a warner and so you shall have no excuse. God has power over all things including punishing you for not following him the Messenger.
The Table Spread,5,20,"And (remember) when Moses said unto his people: O my people! Remember Allah’s favour unto you, how He placed among you prophets, and He made you kings, and gave you that (which) He gave not to any (other) of (His) creatures.",And mention when Moses said to his people ‘O my people remember God’s favour to you when He established among you that is from among you prophets and established you as kings possessing servants and retinues and gave you such as He had not given to any in all the worlds in the way of manna and quails the parting of the sea and other things.
The Table Spread,5,21,"O my people! Go into the holy land which Allah hath ordained for you. Turn not in flight, for surely ye turn back as losers:",O my people enter the Holy the purified Land which God has ordained for you which He commanded you to enter and this is Syria al-shām and do not turn back in flight do not retreat in fear of the enemy or you will end up as losers’ in your efforts.
The Table Spread,5,22,"They said: O Moses! Lo! a giant people (dwell) therein and lo! we go not in till they go forth from thence. When they go forth from thence, then we will enter (not till then).",They said ‘O Moses there are giants in it those remaining of the people of ‘Ād who were very tall and mighty; we will never enter it until they depart from it; if they depart from it then we will enter’ it.
The Table Spread,5,23,"Then out spake two of those who feared (their Lord, men) unto whom Allah had been gracious: Enter in upon them by the gate, for if ye enter by it, lo! ye will be victorious. So put your trust (in Allah) if ye are indeed believers.",There said to them two men of those who feared contravening God’s command and these were Joshua and Caleb — who were from among the leaders that Moses dispatched to bring back news of those giants — to whom God had been gracious by making them virtuous for they concealed what they had discovered about the giants telling only Moses unlike the other leaders who divulged the news and so the people became cowardly. ‘Enter against them by the gate! the gate of the town and have no fear of them for they are bodies without hearts. For if you enter by it you will be victorious the two Joshua and Caleb said this because they were certain of God’s assistance and the fulfilment of His promise. Put your trust in God if you are believers’.
The Table Spread,5,24,They said: O Moses! We will never enter (the land) while they are in it. So go thou and thy Lord and fight! We will sit here.,They said ‘O Moses we will never enter it so long as they are in it. So go forth you and your Lord and fight them we will be sitting here’ away from the fighting.
The Table Spread,5,25,"He said: My Lord! I have control of none but myself and my brother, so distinguish between us and the wrong-doing folk.",He Moses thereupon said ‘My Lord I control none but myself and my brother and I control no one else to be able to force them to obedience. So separate distinguish us from the wicked folk’.
The Table Spread,5,26,"(Their Lord) said: For this the land will surely be forbidden them for forty years that they will wander in the earth, bewildered. So grieve not over the wrongdoing folk.",He God exalted be He said to him ‘Then it the Holy Land shall be forbidden them to enter for forty years; they shall wander lost bewildered in the land — according to Ibn ‘Abbās this land was about nine parasangs sc. 30 miles; so do not grieve for the wicked folk’. It is reported that they would travel throughout the night earnestly but in the morning would find themselves back where they had started. And they would travel all day with the same result until they all perished except those under twenty years of age. It is said that they numbered 600000. Moses and Aaron died in the wilderness and this was a mercy for them and a chastisement for those others. When Moses was on the verge of death he asked his Lord to bring him close to the Holy Land to within a stone’s throw and He did as related in hadīth. Joshua became a prophet sometime after his fortieth year and he was commanded to fight against the giants. So he sallied forth with those that remained by his side and he fought against them; it was a Friday and the sun stopped for him for an hour until he had finished with fighting them. Ahmad b. Hanbal reported in his Musnad the following hadīth ‘The sun was never detained for any human except for Joshua during those days in which he marched towards the Holy House of Jerusalem’.
The Table Spread,5,27,"But recite unto them with truth the tale of the two sons of Adam, how they offered each a sacrifice, and it was accepted from the one of them and it was not accepted from the other. (The one) said: I will surely kill thee. (The other) answered: Allah accepteth only from those who ward off (evil).",And recite O Muhammad (s) to them your people the story the tale of the two sons of Adam Abel and Cain truthfully bi’l-haqq is semantically connected to utlu ‘recite’ how they each offered a sacrifice to God which in Abel’s case was a ram and in Cain’s some green crops and it was accepted from one of them namely from Abel when a fire came down from the heaven and consumed his offering and not accepted from the other that is from Cain and so he became furious and kept secret his envy until Adam left on pilgrimage. He said to him ‘I will surely slay you’ and the other said ‘Why?’ to which the first replied ‘Because only your offering was accepted’. The other said ‘God accepts only from the God-fearing’.
The Table Spread,5,28,"Even if thou stretch out thy hand against me to kill me, I shall not stretch out my hand against thee to kill thee, lo! I fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.",‘Yet if la-in the lām is for oaths you extend your hand against me to slay me I will not extend my hand against you to slay you; I fear God the Lord of the Worlds in slaying you.
The Table Spread,5,29,Lo! I would rather thou shouldst bear the punishment of the sin against me and thine own sin and become one of the owners of the fire. That is the reward of evil-doers.,I desire that you should end up with my sin the sin of slaying me and your own sin the one that you had committed before and so become an inhabitant of the Fire whereas I do not want to end up with your sin if I were to slay you and become one of them. God exalted be He says that is the requital of the evildoers’.
The Table Spread,5,30,"But (the other’s) mind imposed on him the killing of his brother, so he slew him and became one of the losers.",Then his soul prompted him it seduced him to slay his brother so he slew him and became one of the losers by slaying him. And he did not know what to do with him because he was the first of the Children of Adam to die on earth and so he carried him on his back.
The Table Spread,5,31,"Then Allah sent a raven scratching up the ground, to show him how to hide his brother’s naked corpse. He said: Woe unto me! Am I not able to be as this raven and so hide my brother’s naked corpse ? And he became repentant.",Then God sent forth a raven scratching into the earth digging up the soil with its beak and with its legs and throwing it up over a dead raven next to it until it completely hid it to show him how he might hide the nakedness the carcass of his brother. He said ‘Woe to me! Am I not able to be as this raven and so hide my brother’s nakedness?’ And he became one of the remorseful for having carried him; he then dug a hole for him and covered him up.
The Table Spread,5,32,"For that cause We decreed for the Children of Israel that whosoever killeth a human being for other than manslaughter or corruption in the earth, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind, and whoso saveth the life of one, it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind. Our messengers came unto them of old with clear proofs (of Allah’s Sovereignty), but afterwards lo! many of them became prodigals in the earth.",Because of that which Cain did We decreed for the Children of Israel that whoever slays a soul for other than a soul slain or for other than corruption committed in the land in the way of unbelief fornication or waylaying and the like it shall be as if he had slain mankind altogether; and whoever saves the life of one by refraining from slaying it shall be as if he had saved the life of all mankind — Ibn ‘Abbās said that the above is meant in the sense of violating and protecting its a soul’s sanctity respectively. Our messengers have already come to them that is to the Children of Israel with clear proofs miracles but after that many of them still commit excesses in the land overstepping the bounds through disbelief killing and the like.
The Table Spread,5,33,"The only reward of those who make war upon Allah and His messenger and strive after corruption in the land will be that they will be killed or crucified, or have their hands and feet on alternate sides cut off, or will be expelled out of the land. Such will be their degradation in the world, and in the Hereafter theirs will be an awful doom;",The following was revealed when the ‘Arniyyūn came to Medina suffering from some illness and the Prophet s gave them permission to go and drink from the camels’ urine and milk. Once they felt well they slew the Prophet’s shepherd and stole the herd of camels Truly the only requital of those who fight against God and His Messenger by fighting against Muslims and hasten about the earth to do corruption there by waylaying is that they shall be slaughtered or crucified or have their hands and feet cut off on opposite sides that is their right hands and left feet or be banished from the land the aw ‘or’ is used to indicate the separate application of each of the cases listed; thus death is for those that have only killed; crucifixion is for those that have killed and stolen property; the cutting off of limbs on opposite sides is for those that have stolen property but have not killed; while banishment is for those that pose a threat — this was stated by Ibn ‘Abbās and is the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī; the more sound of his al-Shāfi‘ī’s two opinions is that crucifixion should be for three days after the death of the killer or it is also said shortly before he is killed; with banishment are included similar punishments such as imprisonment and the like. That mentioned requital is a degradation a humiliation for them in this world; and in the Hereafter theirs will be a great chastisement namely the chastisement of the Fire.
The Table Spread,5,34,"Save those who repent before ye overpower them. For know that Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.",Except for such warmongers and waylayers as repent before you overpower them; for know that God is Forgiving to them of what they have done Merciful to them. This proviso is expressed without any statement to the effect ‘do not submit them to prescribed legal punishment’ to point out that when such a person repents only God’s prescribed punishments hudūd — and not those deriving from the rights of human beings — are waived. This is how I see it. I do not know of any that have tackled this topic and God knows best. If then a person has killed and stolen property he should be killed and have his limbs cut off on opposite sides but not crucified — this is the more sound of two opinions held by al-Shāfi‘ī. However his repentance is of no avail once he has been overpowered by the authorities — this is also the more sound of two opinions held by him.
The Table Spread,5,35,"O ye who believe! Be mindful of your duty to Allah, and seek the way of approach unto Him, and strive in His way in order that ye may succeed.",O you who believe fear God fear His chastisement by being obedient to Him and seek the means to Him that obedience which brings you closer to Him and struggle in His way in order to elevate His religion; so that you might prosper triumph.
The Table Spread,5,36,"As for those who disbelieve, lo! if all that is in the earth were theirs, and as much again therewith, to ransom them from the doom on the Day of Resurrection, it would not be accepted from them. Theirs will be a painful doom.",Truly as for the disbelievers if they possessed definitely all that is in the earth and the like of it with it by which to ransom themselves from the chastisement of the Day of Resurrection it would not be accepted from them; theirs shall be a painful chastisement.
The Table Spread,5,37,"They will wish to come forth from the Fire, but they will not come forth from it. Theirs will be a lasting doom.",They will desire they will wish to exit from the Fire but they will not exit from it; theirs shall be a lasting a perpetual chastisement.
The Table Spread,5,38,"As for the thief, both male and female, cut off their hands. It is the reward of their own deeds, an exemplary punishment from Allah. Allah is Mighty, Wise.",And the thieving male and the thieving female the definite article in both nouns relates to the subject sc. wa’lladhī saraqa wa’llatī saraqat ‘And the male who thieves and the female who thieves’; because this clause resembles a conditional statement sc. ‘if he thieves if she thieves’ etc. the fā’ has been included in the predicate fa’qta‘ū ‘then cut off’ cut off their hands that is the right hand of each of the two from the wristbone; it is explained in the Sunna that the amputation applies to the stealing of a quarter of a dinar and upwards and if the person were to re-offend the left foot should then be amputated from the ankle and then on subsequent re-offending the left hand is amputated followed by the right foot after which discretionary punishment is applied; as a requital jazā’an is in the accusative because it is a verbal noun for what they have earned and an exemplary punishment for both of them from God; God is Mighty His way will prevail Wise in His creation.
The Table Spread,5,39,"But whoso repenteth after his wrongdoing and amendeth, lo! Allah will relent toward him. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.",But whoever repents after his evildoing refrains from theft and amends his actions God will relent to him. God is indeed Forgiving Merciful in expressing what has been stated. However the rights of the victim to have the penalty of amputation carried out and his property restored are not automatically forgone after repentance. In fact as is clarified in the Sunna only if he is pardoned before being taken to the Imam is the punishment of amputation waived and al-Shāfi‘ī is of this opinion.
The Table Spread,5,40,"Knowest thou not that unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth ? He punisheth whom He will, and forgiveth whom He will. Allah is Able to do all things.",Do you not know the interrogative here is meant as an affirmative that to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth? He chastises him for whom He wills chastisement for and forgives him for whom He wills forgiveness and God has power over all things including chastising and forgiving.
The Table Spread,5,41,"O Messenger! Let not them grieve thee who vie one with another in the race to disbelief, of such as say with their mouths: ""We believe,"" but their hearts believe not, and of the Jews: listeners for the sake of falsehood, listeners on behalf of other folk who come not unto thee, changing words from their context and saying: If this be given unto you, receive it, but if this be not given unto you, then beware! He whom Allah doometh unto sin, thou (by thine efforts) wilt avail him naught against Allah. Those are they for whom the Will of Allah is that He cleanse not their hearts. Theirs in the world will be ignominy, and in the Hereafter an awful doom;",O Messenger let them not grieve you the actions of those who vie with one another in disbelief falling headlong into it in other words they who manifest it at every opportunity of min here is explicative such as say with their mouths with their tongues bi-alsinatihim is semantically connected to qālū ‘such as say’ ‘We believe’ but their hearts do not believe and these are the hypocrites; and from among those of Jewry there is a folk who listen to calumny fabricated by their rabbis listening acceptingly listening to you on behalf of some other folk from among the Jews who have not come to you these were the inhabitants of Khaybar among whom two married persons committed adultery but whom they did not want to stone. And so they dispatched men from Qurayza to ask the Prophet s about the ruling concerning the two; perverting words that are in the Torah such as the ‘stoning’ verse from their contexts the contexts in which God had placed them that is to say substituting them saying to the ones they dispatched ‘If you are given this distorted ruling that is flogging which Muhammad (s) has pronounced for you as a ruling then take it accept it; but if you are not given it and he pronounces some other ruling for you then beware!’ of accepting it! Whomever God desires to try to lead astray you cannot avail him anything against God by preventing such a trial. Those are they whose hearts God did not desire to purify of unbelief for had He desired it you would have been able to do something for them; theirs shall be degradation in this world humiliation by being disgraced and subjected to the jizya and in the Hereafter theirs shall be a great chastisement.
The Table Spread,5,42,"Listeners for the sake of falsehood! Greedy for illicit gain! If then they have recourse unto thee (Muhammad) judge between them or disclaim jurisdiction. If thou disclaimest jurisdiction, then they cannot harm thee at all. But if thou judgest, judge between them with equity. Lo! Allah loveth the equitable.",They are listeners to calumny and consumers of unlawful gain read suhut or suht that which is illicit such as bribes. If they come to you to judge between them then judge between them or turn away from them the second option given here was abrogated by His saying So judge between them to the end of the verse Q. 548. Therefore we Muslims are obliged to judge between them if they request arbitration before us — and this is the more sound of al-Shāfi‘ī’s two opinions. If their request for arbitration involves a Muslim however then we are obliged to judge according to the consensus of legal scholars and not just al-Shāfi‘ī; if you turn away from them they cannot harm you at all; and if you judge between them then judge justly between them; God loves the just those that judge fairly meaning that He will reward them.
The Table Spread,5,43,"How come they unto thee for judgment when they have the Torah, wherein Allah hath delivered judgment (for them) ? Yet even after that they turn away. Such (folk) are not believers.",But how is it that they make you their judge when they have the Torah wherein is God’s judgement of stoning the interrogative here is for provoking amazement in other words they were not seeking thereby by making you their judge to discover the truth but a lighter punishment for them; and then they turn away and then they reject your ruling of stoning which accords with what is in their Scripture after that request to you for arbitration? Such are not believers.
The Table Spread,5,44,"Lo! We did reveal the Torah, wherein is guidance and a light, by which the prophets who surrendered (unto Allah) judged the Jews, and the rabbis and the priests (judged) by such of Allah’s Scripture as they were bidden to observe, and thereunto were they witnesses. So fear not mankind, but fear Me. And My revelations for a little gain. Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed: such are disbelievers.",Surely We revealed the Torah wherein is guidance from error and light that is an exposition of the rulings by which the prophets from the Children of Israel who had submitted who had been compliant before God judged for those of Jewry as did the rabbis the scholars among them and the priests the jurists according to because of that which they were bidden to observe that which was entrusted to them that is to say that which God bid them to observe of God’s Scripture lest they change it and were witnesses to its truth. So do not fear men O Jews in disclosing what you have pertaining to the descriptions of Muhammad (s) the ‘stoning’ verse and otherwise; but fear Me when you conceal it; and do not sell do not exchange My signs for a small price of this world which you take in return for concealing them. Whoever does not judge according to what God has revealed — such are the disbelievers in it.

Whoso judgeth not by that which Allah hath revealed: such are wrong-doers.",And therein in the Torah We prescribed We made obligatory for them that a life be slain in return for a life if it has slain one; and an eye should be gouged out for an eye and a nose is to be cut off for a nose and an ear is to be amputated for an ear and a tooth should be pulled out for a tooth a variant reading has the last four nouns in the nominative; and for wounds read wa’l-jurūhu or wa’l-jurūha retaliation that is the person is entitled to retaliate if this is feasible as in the case of a hand or a leg; but in cases where one is not able to retaliate this is left to arbitration. Although this stipulation was prescribed for them it is established in our Law; but whoever forgoes it that is retaliation out of charity able to restrain himself then that shall be an expiation for him of what he has done of other sins. Whoever does not judge according to what God has revealed in the matter of retaliation and otherwise those are the evildoers.
The Table Spread,5,46,"And We caused Jesus, son of Mary, to follow in their footsteps, confirming that which was (revealed) before him in the Torah, and We bestowed on him the Gospel wherein is guidance and a light, confirming that which was (revealed) before it in the Torah - a guidance and an admonition unto those who ward off (evil).",And We caused Jesus son of Mary to follow in their that is the prophets’ footsteps confirming the Torah before him; and We gave to him the Gospel wherein is guidance from error and light an exposition of the rulings confirming musaddiqan is a circumstantial qualifier the Torah before it the rulings contained therein and as a guidance and an admonition to the God-fearing.

So judge between them between the People of the Scripture if they take their cases before you according to what God has revealed to you and do not follow their whims deviating away from the truth that has come to you. To every one of you O communities We have appointed a divine law and a way a clear path in religion for them to proceed along. If God had willed He would have made you one community following one Law but He separated you one from the other that He may try you in what He has given to you of the differing Laws in order to see who among you is obedient and who is disobedient. So vie with one another in good works strive hastily thereunto; to God you shall all return through resurrection and He will then inform you of that in which you differed in the matter of religion and requite each of you according to his deeds.

Who is better than Allah for judgment to a people who have certainty (in their belief) ?,Do they desire yabghūn is also read tabghūn ‘do you desire?’ do they seek the judgement of paganism through their deceit and deviation when they turn away? this is an interrogative meant as a disavowal. Yet who that is no one is better in judgement than God for a people knowing Him with certainty? These people are singled out for mention because they are the ones who reflect.
The Table Spread,5,51,O ye who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians for friends. They are friends one to another. He among you who taketh them for friends is (one) of them. Lo! Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.,O you who believe do not take Jews and Christians as patrons affiliating with them or showing them affection; they are patrons of each other being united in disbelief.

And it may happen that Allah will vouchsafe (unto thee) the victory, or a commandment from His presence. Then will they repent them of their secret thoughts.",And you see those in whose hearts is sickness weakness of faith the like of ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy the hypocrite; vying with one another for them to affiliate with them saying as an excuse for this ‘We fear lest we suffer a turn of fortune’ which time will bring round against us such as drought or defeat and that if Muhammad’s affair should come to nothing they will cease to supply us with provisions. God exalted be He says But it may be that God will bring victory by assisting His Prophet and making His religion prevail; or some commandment from Him that will reveal the secrets of the hypocrites disgracing them; and then they will end up for what they kept secret within themselves in the way of doubt and affiliating with disbelievers remorseful.

But keep your duty to Allah if ye are true believers.",O you who believe do not take as patrons those who take your religion in mockery as something to be mocked and as a game from among min is explicative those who were given the Scripture before you and from among the disbelievers read al-kuffāri or al-kuffāra the idolaters — and fear God by refraining from affiliating with them if you are believers if you are truthful in your faith.
The Table Spread,5,58,And when ye call to prayer they take it for a jest and sport. That is because they are a folk who understand not.,And those who when you make the call to prayer take it that is the prayer in mockery and as a game mocking it and laughing at it among themselves; that mocking attitude is because they are a people who do not understand.
The Table Spread,5,59,"Say: O People of the Scripture! Do ye blame us for aught else than that we believe in Allah and that which is revealed unto us and that which was revealed aforetime, and because most of you are evil-livers ?",The following was revealed when the Jews said to the Prophet s ‘Whom among the messengers do you believe in?’ and he replied in God and in that which has been revealed to us Q. 2136 and when he mentioned Jesus they said ‘We know of no religion worse than yours!’ Say ‘O People of the Scripture do you spite do you repudiate us for any other cause than that we believe in God and what has been revealed to us and what was revealed to the prophets before and that most of you are wicked?’ wa-anna aktharakum fāsiqūn is a supplement to an āmannā ‘that we believe’ that is to say ‘What you repudiate in fact is our faith and your opposition to it in refusing to accept it — a refusal which is described as ‘wickedness’ this wickedness itself being the necessary consequence of such a refusal — but in fact this faith of ours is not something to be repudiated’.
The Table Spread,5,60,"Shall I tell thee of a worse (case) than theirs for retribution with Allah ?

They are worse situated makānan is for specification for their abode shall be the Fire and further astray from the even way’ from the path of truth al-sawā’ originally means al-wasat ‘middle’; the use of sharrun ‘worse’ and adallu ‘further astray’ is intended to counter their saying ‘We know of no religion worse sharrun than yours’.
The Table Spread,5,61,"When they come unto you (Muslims), they say: We believe; but they came in unbelief and they went out in the same; and Allah knoweth best what they were hiding.",When they the hypocrites from among the Jews come to you they say ‘We believe’; but they have entered unto you ensconced in disbelief and so they have departed from you ensconced in it and they have not believed. And God knows very well what they were hiding of hypocrisy.
The Table Spread,5,62,And thou seest many of them vying one with another in sin and transgression and their devouring of illicit gain. Verily evil is what they do.,And you see many of them namely the Jews vying falling headlong in sin in calumny and enmity wrongdoing and their consuming of unlawful gain what is illicit like bribes; evil is that deed of theirs which they have been committing.
The Table Spread,5,63,Why do not the rabbis and the priests forbid their evil-speaking and their devouring of illicit gain ? Verily evil is their handiwork.,Why do the rabbis and the priests among them not forbid them from uttering sin calumny and consuming unlawful gain? Evil is what they have been doing in refraining from forbidding them.
The Table Spread,5,64,"The Jews say: Allah’s hand is fettered. Their hands are fettered and they are accursed for saying so. Nay, but both His hands are spread out wide in bounty. He bestoweth as He will. That which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord is certain to increase the contumacy and disbelief of many of them, and We have cast among them enmity and hatred till the Day of Resurrection. As often as they light a fire for war, Allah extinguisheth it. Their effort is for corruption in the land, and Allah loveth not corrupters.",The Jews said when their circumstances became straitened on account of their denial of the Prophet s after having been the wealthiest of people ‘God’s hand is fettered’ withholding the sending forth of provision upon us — this was their metaphor for niggardliness — may God be exalted above this. God exalted be He says Fettered be withheld be their hands from the performance of good deeds as an invocation against them; and they are cursed for what they have said. Nay but His hands are extended out wide — a hyperbole for the attribute of generosity — the use of yadā the dual for yad ‘hand’ is intended to imply abundance since the utmost that an affluent person can give freely of his wealth is when he gives it with both hands. He expends how He will in giving abundantly or straitening and there can be no objection to this. And what has been revealed to you from your Lord of the Qur’ān will surely increase many of them in insolence and disbelief because of their very disbelief in it; and We have cast between them enmity and hatred until the Day of Resurrection and so every sect among them is opposed to the other. Every time they light the fires of war that is for war against the Prophet s God extinguishes them that is every time they desire it war He repels them. And they hasten about the earth in corruption that is they hasten about corrupting through acts of disobedience and God does not love corrupters meaning that He will punish them.
The Table Spread,5,65,"If only the People of the Scripture would believe and ward off (evil), surely We should remit their sins from them and surely We should bring them into Gardens of Delight.",But had the People of the Scripture believed in Muhammad (s) and feared unbelief We would have absolved them of their evil deeds and We would admitted them to Gardens of Bliss.

Allah will protect thee from mankind. Lo! Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk.",O Messenger make known all of that which has been revealed to you from your Lord and do not conceal any of it out of fear that you may suffer some harm; for if you do not that is if you do not make known all of what has been revealed to you you will not have conveyed His Message risālatahu or read plural risālātihi ‘His Messages’ since to conceal some of it is to conceal it all. God will protect you from people who may try to kill you. The Prophet s used to have guards up until the time that this verse was revealed then he said ‘Depart for God protects me now’ as reported by al-Hākim. God does not guide the unbelieving folk.

The Table Spread,5,69,"Lo! those who believe, and those who are Jews, and Sabaeans, and Christians - Whosoever believeth in Allah and the Last Day and doeth right - there shall no fear come upon them neiither shall they grieve.",Surely those who believe and those of Jewry this constitutes the subject of the clause namely the Jews and the Sabaeans a sect among them and the Christians and what follows substitutes for the above subject whoever of them believes in God and the Last Day and behaves righteously — no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter this fa-lā khawfun ‘alayhim wa-lā hum yahzanūn ‘no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve’ is the predicate of the subject and also indicates the predicate of the clause beginning with inna ‘surely’.
The Table Spread,5,70,We made a covenant of old with the Children of Israel and We sent unto them messengers. As often as a messenger came unto them with that which their souls desired not (they became rebellious). Some (of them) they denied and some they slew.,And We made a covenant with the Children of Israel to believe in God and His messengers and We sent messengers to them. Every time a messenger came to them from among them with what their souls did not desire in the way of truth they denied it; some of them they denied and some of them they slay such as Zachariah and John the use of the present tense yaqtulūn ‘they slay’ instead of the perfect tense qatalū is to narrate past events as if in the present and to conclude in harmony with the end-rhyme of the verses.
The Table Spread,5,71,"They thought no harm would come of it, so they were wilfully blind and deaf. And afterward Allah turned (in mercy) toward them. Now (even after that) are many of them wilfully blind and deaf.

Then God relented to them when they repented then they were wilfully blind and deaf a second time many of them kathīrun minhum substitutes for the third person ‘they’; and God sees what they do and will requite them for it.
The Table Spread,5,72,"They surely disbelieve who say: Lo! Allah is the Messiah, son of Mary. The Messiah (himself) said: O Children of Israel, worship Allah, my Lord and your Lord. Lo! whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah, for him Allah hath forbidden paradise. His abode is the Fire. For evil-doers there will be no helpers.",They indeed are disbelievers those who say ‘Indeed God is the Messiah son of Mary’ a similar verse has preceded Q. 517. For the Messiah said to them ‘O Children of Israel worship God my Lord and your Lord for I am a servant and not a god. Verily he who associates anything with God in worship for him God has made Paradise forbidden He has forbidden him admittance to it and his abode shall be the Fire; and for wrongdoers wa-mā li’l-zālimīna min the min is extra there shall be no helpers’ to guard them against the chastisement of God.

The Table Spread,5,75,"The Messiah, son of Mary, was no other than a messenger, messengers (the like of whom) had passed away before him. And his mother was a saintly woman. And they both used to eat (earthly) food. See how We make the revelations clear for them, and see how they are turned away!",The Messiah son of Mary was only a messenger; messengers passed away before him and so he passed away like them for he is not a god as they claim otherwise he would not have passed away; his mother was a truthful woman siddīqa means extremely truthful; they both used to eat food like all other human beings and one who is such cannot be a god because of his compound being and fallible nature and because of the impurities such as urine and excrement that he produces. Behold in amazement how We make the signs of Our Oneness clear to them then behold how they are turned away! how they are turned away from the truth despite the proof being established.

Q. 5115 below — that cursing was because of their disobedience and their transgression.
The Table Spread,5,79,They restrained not one another from the wickedness they did. Verily evil was that they used to do!,They did not prevent one another that is one would not forbid the other from committing again any indecency that they committed; verily evil was what they used to do verily evil was this deed of theirs.
The Table Spread,5,80,Thou seest many of them making friends with those who disbelieve. Surely ill for them is that which they themselves send on before them: that Allah will be wroth with them and in the doom they will abide.,You O Muhammad (s) see many of them affiliating with those who disbelieve from among the Meccans out of spite for you. Evil is that in the way of deeds which their souls have offered on their behalf for the day of their inevitable return such that God is wroth with them and in the chastisement they shall abide.

The Table Spread,5,83,"When they listen to that which hath been revealed unto the messengers, thou seest their eyes overflow with tears because of their recognition of the Truth. They say: Our Lord, we believe.

And (how should we not) hope that our Lord will bring us in along with righteous folk ?,And in response to those Jews who reviled them for their Islam they would say why should we not believe in God and what has come to us of the truth the Qur’ān that is to say there is nothing to prevent us from faith when its prerequisites are present; and hope natma‘u is a supplement to nu’minu ‘we believe’ that our Lord should admit us with the righteous people?’ the believers into Paradise?
The Table Spread,5,85,"Allah hath rewarded them for that their saying - Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the reward of the good.",God exalted be He says So God has rewarded them for what they have said with Gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide; that is the requital of those who are virtuous by believing.

The Table Spread,5,87,"O ye who believe! Forbid not the good things which Allah hath made lawful for you, and transgress not, Lo! Allah loveth not transgressors.",When a number of Companions resolved to practise fasting and night vigil continuously and to abstain from women perfume consumption of meat and sleeping on beds the following was revealed O you who believe do not forbid the good things that God has made lawful for you and do not transgress do not exceed God’s command; God does not love transgressors.
The Table Spread,5,88,"Eat of that which Allah hath bestowed on you as food lawful and good, and keep your duty to Allah in Whom ye are believers.",And eat of the lawful and good food which God has provided you halālan tayyiban ‘lawful and good food’ is the direct object and the preceding genitive construction mimmā ‘of … which’ is a circumstantial qualifier connected to the former; and fear God in Whom you are believers.
The Table Spread,5,89,"Allah will not take you to task for that which is unintentional in your oaths, but He will take you to task for the oaths which ye swear in earnest. The expiation thereof is the feeding of ten of the needy with the average of that wherewith ye feed your own folk, or the clothing of them, or the liberation of a slave, and for him who findeth not (the wherewithal to do so) then a three days’ fast. This is the expiation of your oaths when ye have sworn; and keep your oaths. Thus Allah expoundeth unto you His revelations in order that ye may give thanks.",God will not take you to task for a slip contained in your oaths which is what the tongue utters spontaneously without intending to swear an oath such as when one says ‘No by God’ or ‘Yes by God’; but He will take you to task for that to which you have pledged read ‘aqadtum ‘aqqadttum or ‘āqadttum oaths where you have sworn an oath intentionally; the expiation thereof of the oath if you break it is the feeding of ten of the needy for each needy person one mudd measure of the midmost food from which you feed your families that is the closest or the principal food you consume neither better nor worse; or the clothing of them with what may be properly called clothes such as a shirt a turban or a loin cloth — it is not sufficient that these items mentioned be given only to one needy person according to al-Shāfi‘ī; or the setting free of a believing slave as applies in the expiation for slaying or repudiation through zihār interpreting the general stipulation in a restricted sense; and whoever does not find the means for any one of the expiations mentioned then the fasting of three days as an expiation for him — as it appears in this verse it is not obligatory to follow the above sequence of alternatives when making an expiation and this is the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī. That which is mentioned is the expiation of your oaths if you have sworn and have broken them; but keep your oaths do not break them unless it be for a righteous deed or setting right between people as stated in the verse of sūrat al-Baqara Q. 2225. So in the same way that He has explained to you what has been mentioned God makes clear to you His signs so that you might be thankful to Him for this.

Leave it aside in order that ye may succeed.,O you who believe verily wine that intoxicates and overcomes the mind and games of chance gambling and idols and divinatory arrows are an abomination an evil deemed vile of Satan’s work which he adorns; so avoid it this abomination consisting of the things mentioned do not do it; so that you might prosper.

The Table Spread,5,94,"O ye who believe!

Whoso transgresseth after this, for him there is a painful doom.",O you who believe God will surely try you He will surely test you with some game which He releases to you the smaller of which will be caught by your hands and the larger of which by your lances this was in the plain of al-Hudaybiyya; while they were in the state of pilgrimage inviolability beasts and birds would flock to their caravans; so that God may know through knowledge outwardly manifested who fears Him in the Unseen bi’l-ghayb is a circumstantial qualifier in other words while He is absent to the eyes one who does not see Him but nonetheless avoids hunting game. Whoever transgresses thereafter after that prohibition against it and hunts his shall be a painful chastisement.

Whoso of you killeth it of set purpose he shall pay its forfeit in the equivalent of that which he hath killed, of domestic animals, the judge to be two men among you known for justice, (the forfeit) to be brought as an offering to the Ka’bah; or, for expiation, he shall feed poor persons, or the equivalent thereof in fasting, that he may taste the evil consequences of his deed.

Or it is incumbent on him to make an expiation other than compensation and if he should find the means then this expiation is food for the poor food to be taken from the principal food of the town equivalent to the value of the compensation being one mudd measure for each poor person a variant reading has kaffāra ‘expiation’ in an annexation with the following noun sc.
The Table Spread,5,96,"To hunt and to eat the fish of the sea is made lawful for you, a provision for you and for seafarers; but to hunt on land is forbidden you so long as ye are on the pilgrimage.

So do not ask about them; indeed God has pardoned those things you asked about so do not ask again; for God is Forgiving Forbearing.
The Table Spread,5,102,A folk before you asked (for such disclosures) and then disbelieved therein.,Verily a people before you asked about them that is they asked their prophets about such things and they received the response in the form of revealed explications of the rules concerning them; and then they disbelieved in them by neglecting to implement them.
The Table Spread,5,103,"Allah hath not appointed anything in the nature of a Bahirah or a Sa’ibah or a Wasilah or a Hami, but those who disbelieve invent a lie against Allah. Most of them have no sense.",God has not ordained He has not stipulated in His Law anything such as a Bahīra a Sā’iba a Wasīla or a Hām in the way that people did at the time of paganism. Al-Bukhārī reported in a hadīth from Sa‘īd b. al-Musayyab who said ‘The bahīra is that camel whose milk is consecrated to idols and whom no human may milk; the sā’iba is the one they would leave to roam freely for their gods and was forbidden to bear any load; the wasīla is the young she-camel that would give birth to a young female as its first offspring followed by another female bearing one after the other without a male in between she would then be left to roam freely for their idols; the hām is the mature male camel which after completing a certain number of copulations with a female would then be consigned to their idols and be exempt from bearing any load and they would call it hāmī; but the disbelievers invent lies against God in this matter by attributing the sanctioning of such practices to Him; and most of them do not understand that this is mendacity for in this they have merely followed the example of their forefathers.
The Table Spread,5,104,"And when it is said unto them: Come unto that which Allah hath revealed and unto the messenger, they say: Enough for us is that wherein we found our fathers. What! Even though their fathers had no knowledge whatsoever, and no guidance ?",And when it is said to them ‘Come to what God has revealed and to the Messenger’ that is to His ruling concerning the permitting of what you have forbidden they say ‘What we have found our fathers following suffices us’ in the way of religion and laws. God exalted be He says What does that suffice them even if their fathers knew nothing and were not guided? to any truth the interrogative is meant as a disavowal.
The Table Spread,5,105,O ye who believe! Ye have charge of your own souls. He who erreth cannot injure you if ye are rightly guided. Unto Allah ye will all return; and then He will inform you of what ye used to do.,O you who believe you are responsible for your own souls in other words preserve them and do what is in their best interest; he who is astray cannot hurt you if you are rightly guided it is said that this means ‘None of those misguided ones from among the People of the Scripture can hurt you’; it is also said to mean others on the basis of the following hadīth of Abū Tha‘laba al-Khushanī ‘I asked the Messenger of God s about it this verse and he said “Enjoin one other to decency and forbid one another indecency and then if you see niggardliness being obeyed whims being followed this present world being preferred and every intelligent person proud of his own opinions then you are still responsible for looking after your own soul”’ as reported by al-Hākim and others.

Then you shall empanel them you shall detain them tahbisūnahumā ‘you shall empanel them’ is an adjectival qualification of ākharān ‘two others’ after the mid-afternoon prayer and if you are in doubt if you are uncertain about it their testimony they shall swear by God both of them saying ‘We will not sell it our testimony in swearing by God for any price for any compensation that we might take in exchange for it from this world neither by swearing by Him falsely nor by testifying falsely for the sake of that price; even if he the person before whom it is being sworn or the one for whose sake testimony is being given be a near kinsman a close relative of ours nor will we hide testimony to God which He has commanded us to give for then if we were to hide it we would surely be among the sinful’.

If the inheritors have doubts about the two men and claim a breach of faith on the part of the two for having taken something or given it to some other person — alleging that the deceased bequeathed it to him — then let the two men swear in full in the way mentioned above. If then some indication surfaces that the two men have been lying and these two then claim some motivation for this action of theirs the nearest of the inheritors in kinship to the deceased shall swear to the perjury of the two men and to the truth of what they the inheritors suspected. This stipulation holds for the two trustees but is abrogated in the case of the two witnesses. Likewise the testimony of non co-religionists is abrogated.
The Table Spread,5,108,Thus it is more likely that they will bear true witness or fear that after their oaths the oaths (of others) will be taken. So be mindful of your duty (to Allah) and hearken. Allah guideth not the froward folk.,That ruling mentioned where the oath devolves to the inheritors makes it likelier brings closer the eventuality that they the witnesses or the trustees will bear the testimony in its true form the form in which they have been charged to bear it without distortion or breach of faith or it is likelier that they will be afraid that after their oaths other oaths may be taken from the inheritors the plaintiffs who would swear to the two men’s breach of faith or perjury in which case they would be disgraced and would incur penalties and so because of this they will not lie. Fear God by refraining from betrayal and perjury and listen to what you have been commanded listening in acceptance. God does not guide the wicked people those rebelling against obedience to Him; He does not guide the wicked to the way of goodness.

Yet still ye doubt!",It is He Who created you from clay by creating your father Adam from it; then He decreed a term for each of you at the conclusion of which you die.

Cattle,6,8,"They say: Why hath not an angel been sent down unto him ? If We sent down an angel, then the matter would be judged; no further time would be allowed them (for reflection).",And they say ‘Why has an angel not been sent down to him?’ to Muhammad (s) to confirm his truthfulness; yet had We sent down an angel as they have requested and if they then did not believe the matter that they be destroyed would have been decreed and then they would not be given any respite they would not be given any extra time for repentance or an excuse as is God’s custom in dealing with those before them destroying them when they disbelieve after their request is granted.

And He is the most swift of reckoners.",Then they creatures are restored to God their Protector their Possessor the True the Eternal the Just so that He might requite them. Surely His is the judgement the decree that will be carried out in their case. He is the swiftest of reckoners reckoning with the whole of creation in half a day of the days of this world on the basis of a hadīth to this effect.
Cattle,6,63,"Say: Who delivereth you from the darkness of the land and the sea ? Ye call upon Him humbly and in secret, (saying): If we are delivered from this (fear) we truly will be of the thankful.",Say O Muhammad (s) to the people of Mecca ‘Who delivers you from the darkness of the land and the sea from their terrors during your journeys? When you call upon Him openly and secretly saying “Verily if la-in the lām is for oaths You God deliver us anjaytanā is also read anjānā ‘if He delivers us’ from this darkness and hardship we shall truly be among the thankful”’ the believers.
Cattle,6,64,Say: Allah delivereth you from this and from all affliction. Yet ye attribute partners unto Him.,Say to them ‘God delivers you read yunjīkum or yunajjīkum from that and from every distress from every other anxiety. Yet you associate others with Him’.
Cattle,6,65,"Say: He is able to send punishment upon you from above you or from beneath your feet, or to bewilder you with dissension and make you taste the tyranny one of another. See how We display the revelations so that they may understand.",Say ‘He has the power to send forth upon you a chastisement from above you from the heaven such as stones cf. Q. 832 or a Cry cf. Q. 1167 or from beneath your feet such as the causing of the earth to cave in cf. Q. 2940 or to confound you to confuse you in parties sects with differing whims and to make you taste the violence of one another’ through fighting. When this verse was revealed the Prophet s said ‘This chastisement etc. is easier and lighter’; but when the last statement was revealed he said ‘I seek refuge with Your Countenance!’ as reported by al-Bukhārī. Muslim reports the following hadīth ‘I requested from my Lord not to make my community violent towards each other but He denied me this request’. In another hadīth when it was revealed he is reported to have said ‘As for this it will surely come to pass even though its proper meaning has not yet come’. See how We dispense how We clarify for them the signs the proofs of Our power that perhaps they might understand that they might realise that what they follow is falsehood.
Cattle,6,66,"Thy people (O Muhammad) have denied it, though it is the Truth. Say: I am not put in charge of you.",Your people have denied it the Qur’ān. Yet it is the truth. Say to them ‘I am not a guardian over you to requite you. I am only a warner and your affair is left to God — this was revealed before the command to fight the idolaters.
Cattle,6,67,"For every announcement there is a term, and ye will come to know.",Every tiding every announcement has a conclusion a fixed time in which it will take place and be concluded including the tiding concerning your punishment. And you will come to know’ — this is a threat for them.
Cattle,6,68,"And when thou seest those who meddle with Our revelations, withdraw from them until they meddle with another topic. And if the devil cause thee to forget, sit not, after the remembrance, with the congregation of wrong-doers.",When you see those who engage in discourse about Our signs the Qur’ān in mockery turn away from them and do not sit with them until they discourse on some other topic. And if immā the letter nūn of the conditional particle in has been assimilated with the extra mā Satan should make you forget read yunsiyannaka or yunassiyannaka and you sit with them then do not sit after the reminder that is after you remember with the evildoing folk the overt noun al-qawm al-zālimīn ‘the evildoing folk’ replaces the third person pronominalisation.
Cattle,6,69,"Those who ward off (evil) are not accountable for them in aught, but the Reminder (must be given them) that haply they (too) may ward off (evil).",The Muslims then said ‘If we get up and leave every time they delve into the matter of the Qur’ān we would never be able to sit in the Mosque or perform circumambulations. Therefore the following was revealed Those who fear God are not accountable for them for those who discourse in mockery in anything min shay’in min is extra if they should sit with them; but it is the reminder that they are accountable for; a reminder given to make them remember and to admonish them so that perhaps they will be wary of discoursing thus.
Cattle,6,70,"And forsake those who take their religion for a pastime and a jest, and whom the life of the world beguileth. Remind (mankind) hereby lest a soul be destroyed by what it earneth. It hath beside Allah no protecting ally nor intercessor, and though it offer every compensation it will not be accepted from it. Those are they who perish by their own deserts. For them is drink of boiling water and a painful doom, because they disbelieved.",And forsake leave alone those who take their religion with which they have been charged as a game and a diversion making a mockery of it and whom the life of this world has deluded and so do not interfere with them — this was revealed before the command to fight them. Remind admonish people thereby by the Qur’ān lest a soul perish lest it be given up for destruction for what it has earned what it has done; it has no protector no helper besides God other than Him and no intercessor to ward off the chastisement from it; and though it offer every compensation though it pay every ransom it shall not be accepted from it that which it offers as ransom. Those are the ones who perish by what they have earned; for them shall be a draught of boiling water and a painful chastisement because they disbelieved that is for their unbelief.
Cattle,6,71,"Say: Shall we cry, instead of unto Allah, unto that which neither profiteth us nor hurteth us, and shall we turn back after Allah hath guided us, like one bewildered whom the devils have infatuated in the earth, who hath companions who invite him to the guidance (saying): Come unto us ? Say: Lo! the guidance of Allah is Guidance, and we are ordered to surrender to the Lord of the Worlds,",Say ‘Shall we call upon shall we worship instead of God that which neither profits us if we worship them nor hurts us if we neglect to worship them — these are the idols; and so be turned back and so return to idolatry after God has guided us to Islam? — Like one whom the devils have lured led astray in the earth bewildered confused not knowing where to go hayrān ‘bewildered’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the suffixed pronoun hā’ of istahwat-hu ‘whom they have lured’; he has companions a group who call him to guidance that is to say they are there in order to guide him to the right path saying to him “Come to us!”’ but he does not respond to them and he perishes the interrogative statement is meant as a disavowal; the comparative statement beginning with ka’lladhī ‘like one whom’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb nuraddu ‘be turned back’. Say ‘Truly God’s guidance which is Islam is the true guidance everything else being error and we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of the Worlds
Cattle,6,72,"And to establish worship and be dutiful to Him, and He it is unto Whom ye will be gathered.",and to that is to submit by establishing prayer and fearing Him exalted be He; He it is to Whom you shall be gathered’ you shall be brought together on the Day of Resurrection for reckoning.
Cattle,6,73,"He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in truth. In the day when He saith: Be! it is. His Word is the Truth, and His will be the Sovereignty on the day when the trumpet is blown. Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, He is the Wise, the Aware.",He it is Who created the heavens and the earth in truth that is to say with the purpose of manifesting truth. And mention the day He says to a thing ‘Be’ and it is — this is the Day of Resurrection when He says to creatures ‘Rise up’ and they do. His words are the truth the truth that will doubtless come to pass; and His is the Kingdom the day when the trumpet the horn is blown the second blast by the angel Isrāfīl when there shall be no kingdom for any other than Him ‘Whose is the Kingdom today? God’s’ Q. 4016. He is the Knower of the Unseen and the visible what is hidden and what may be seen. He is the Wise in His creation the Aware of things inwardly hidden and outwardly manifest.
Cattle,6,74,(Remember) when Abraham said unto his father Azar: Takest thou idols for gods ? Lo! I see thee and thy folk in error manifest.,And mention when Abraham said to his father Āzar which was his cognomen his first name being Terah Tārikh ‘Do you take idols as gods to worship? an interrogative meant as a rebuke. I see you and your people by this act of taking them as gods in manifest error’ far from the truth.
Cattle,6,75,Thus did We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he might be of those possessing certainty:,And so just as We show him the misguidance of his father and his people We show Abraham the kingdom of the heavens and the earth that he might infer thereby the truth of Our Oneness and that he might be of those knowing it with certainty the sentence beginning with wa-kadhālika ‘and so’ and what follows it is a parenthetical statement and a supplement to the one beginning with qāla ‘he said’.
Cattle,6,76,"When the night grew dark upon him he beheld a star. He said: This is my Lord. But when it set, he said: I love not things that set.",When night descended when it darkened upon him he saw a star — said to have been Venus — and said to his people who were astrologers ‘This is my Lord’ as you are wont to claim. But when it set when it disappeared he said ‘I love not those that set’ to take them as lords because it is not possible for a true Lord to be transformed or to change place as such attributes pertain to accidents — but this had no effect on them.
Cattle,6,77,"And when he saw the moon uprising, he exclaimed: This is my Lord. But when it set, he said: Unless my Lord guide me, I surely shall become one of the folk who are astray.",And when he saw the moon rising appearing he said to them ‘This is my Lord.’ But when it set he said ‘Unless my Lord guides me unless He establishes me within true guidance I shall surely become one of the folk who are astray’ — an intimation to his people that they are astray but still this had no effect on them.
Cattle,6,78,"And when he saw the sun uprising, he cried: This is my Lord! This is greater! And when it set he exclaimed: O my people! Lo! I am free from all that ye associate (with Him).",And when he saw the sun rising he said ‘This is my Lord; this is greater!’ than the star and the moon the masculine demonstrative pronoun hādhā ‘this’ is used for the feminine shams ‘sun’ because the predicate rabbī ‘my Lord’ is masculine. But when it set and the argument against them had become stronger and they still had not repented he said ‘O my people surely I am innocent of what you associate with God in the way of idols and accidental bodies which require an originator. They then asked him ‘What do you worship?’

Cattle,6,80,His people argued with him. He said: Dispute ye with me concerning Allah when He hath guided me ? I fear not at all that which ye set up beside Him unless my Lord willeth aught. My Lord includeth all things in His knowledge. Will ye not then remember ?,But his people disputed with him they argued with him about his religion and threatened him that the idols would strike him with evil if he abandoned them. He said ‘Do you dispute with me read a-tuhājjūnnī or a-tuhājūnī where one of the two letters nūn is omitted the nūn which grammarians refer to as nūn al-raf‘ ‘the nūn of modal independence’ and which the Qur’ānic reciters refer to as nūn al-wiqāya ‘the nūn of preservation’; do you argue with me concerning the Oneness of God when He exalted be He has guided me to it? I have no fear of what you associate with Him in the way of idols that they might strike me with some evil since they have no power to do anything unless my Lord wills something harmful to befall me and it does. My Lord encompasses all things through His knowledge; will you not remember this and believe?

Cattle,6,82,"Those who believe and obscure not their belief by wrongdoing, theirs is safety; and they are rightly guided.",Those who believe and have not confounded mixed their belief with evildoing that is idolatry — explained as such by a hadīth in the two Sahīhs of Bukhārī and Muslim — theirs is security from chastisement; and they are rightly guided.
Cattle,6,83,"That is Our argument. We gave it unto Abraham against his folk. We raise unto degrees of wisdom whom We will. Lo! thy Lord is Wise, Aware.",That tilka is the subject of the sentence and is substituted by the following hujjatunā argument of Ours with which Abraham inferred God’s Oneness as in the case of the setting stars and what came afterwards; the predicate is what follows We bestowed upon Abraham We guided him to it as an argument against his people. We raise up in degrees whom We will read this as a genitive annexation darajāti man nashā’ or as accusative nunation darajātin man nashā’ degrees in knowledge and wisdom; surely your Lord is Wise in His actions Knowing of His creation.
Cattle,6,84,And We bestowed upon him Isaac and Jacob; each of them We guided; and Noah did We guide aforetime; and of his seed (We guided) David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus do We reward the good.,And We bestowed upon him Isaac and his son Jacob; each one of the two We guided. And Noah We guided before that is before Abraham and of his seed that is Noah’s seed David and his son Solomon and Job and Joseph son of Jacob and Moses and Aaron; and so in the same way that We have requited them We requite the virtuous.
Cattle,6,85,And Zachariah and John and Jesus and Elias. Each one (of them) was of the righteous.,And Zachariah and his son John and Jesus son of Mary — this shows that the term ‘seed’ dhurriyya can include offspring from the female side — and Elias the paternal nephew of Aaron brother of Moses; all of them were of the righteous.

Cattle,6,87,With some of their forefathers and their offspring and their brethren; and We chose them and guided them unto a straight path.,And of their fathers and of their seed and of their brethren this clause is a supplement either to the previous kullan ‘all of them’ or to Nūhan ‘Noah’; min ‘of’ is partitive because some of them did not have offspring while others had disbelievers among their offspring; and We chose them and We guided them to a straight path.
Cattle,6,88,"Such is the guidance of Allah wherewith He guideth whom He will of His bondmen. But if they had set up (for worship) aught beside Him, (all) that they did would have been vain.",That religion to which they were guided is God’s guidance wherewith He guides whom He will of His servants; had they hypothetically speaking been idolaters all that they did would have been in vain.
Cattle,6,89,"Those are they unto whom We gave the Scripture and command and prophethood. But if these disbelieve therein, then indeed We shall entrust it to a people who will not be disbelievers therein.",They are the ones to whom We gave the Scripture meaning the Books of God judgement wisdom and prophethood; so if these people of Mecca disbelieve therein that is in these three then indeed We have entrusted it to We have set aside for it a people who do not disbelieve in it namely the Emigrants Muhājirūn and the Helpers Ansār.
Cattle,6,90,"Those are they whom Allah guideth, so follow their guidance. Say (O Muhammad, unto mankind): I ask of you no fee for it. Lo! it is naught but a Reminder to (His) creatures.",They are the ones whom God has guided; so follow their guidance their way of affirming God’s Oneness and of exercising patience read iqtadih ‘follow’ with the silent hā’ whether pausing or continuing the recitation; a variant reading omits it in continuous recitation. Say to the people of Mecca ‘I do not ask of you to give me any wage for it the Qur’ān; it the Qur’ān is only a reminder an admonition to all the worlds’ of mankind and jinn.
Cattle,6,91,"And they measure not the power of Allah its true measure when they say: Allah hath naught revealed unto a human being. Say (unto the Jews who speak thus): Who revealed the Book which Moses brought, a light and guidance for mankind, which ye have put on parchments which ye show, but ye hide much (thereof), and (by which) ye were taught that which ye knew not yourselves nor (did) your fathers (know it) ? Say: Allah. Then leave them to their play of cavilling.",They that is the Jews measured not God with His true measure that is they have not extended Him the grandeur that truly befits Him or it means they have not attained the true knowledge of Him when they said to the Prophet s disputing with him about the Qur’ān ‘God has not revealed anything to any mortal.’ Say to them ‘Who revealed the Book which Moses brought a light and guidance for mankind? You put it in all three instances the verbs may be read either in the third person plural yaj‘alūnahu ‘they put it’; yubdūnahā ‘they reveal it’; wa-yukhfūna ‘and they hide’ or in the second person plural taj‘alūnahu ‘you put it’; tubdūnahā ‘you reveal it’; wa-tukhfūna ‘and you hide’ on parchments that is you write it down on fragments of notes which you disclose that is what you choose to disclose thereof but you hide much of what is in them as in the case of the descriptions of Muhammad (s); and you have been taught O Jews in the Qur’ān what you did not know neither you nor your fathers’ in the Torah through the elucidation therein of what you were confused about and in disagreement over. Say ‘God’ revealed it — and if they do not say it there is no other response — then leave them to play in their discourse their falsehood.
Cattle,6,92,"And this is a blessed Scripture which We have revealed, confirming that which (was revealed) before it, that thou mayst warn the Mother of Villages and those around her.

This day ye are awarded doom of degradation for that ye spake concerning Allah other than the truth, and used to scorn His portents.",And who that is none does greater evil than he who invents lies against God by claiming prophethood when he has not been called to it or who says ‘It is revealed to me’ when nothing has been revealed to him — this was revealed regarding the false prophet Musaylama al-Kadhdhāb — or he who says ‘I will reveal the like of what God has revealed’? — these were the mockers who would say If we wish we can speak the like of this Q. 831; If you could only see O Muhammad (s) when the mentioned evildoers are in the agonies the throes of death and the angels extend their hands against them beating and torturing them saying to them in stern censure ‘Give up your souls! to us that we may seize them. Today you shall be requited with the chastisement of humiliation because you used to say about God other than the truth of claiming prophethood and inspiration falsely and that you used to scorn His signs’ disdaining to believe in them. The response to the conditional statement beginning with law ‘if you could only see’ is ‘you would be seeing a terrifying thing’.
Cattle,6,94,"Now have ye come unto Us solitary as We did create you at the first, and ye have left behind you all that We bestowed upon you, and We behold not with you those your intercessors, of whom ye claimed that they possessed a share in you. Now is the bond between you severed, and that which ye presumed hath failed you.",And it is said to them upon their resurrection ‘And now you have come to Us singly each alone without family possessions or children as We created you the first time that is barefoot naked and with foreskins and you have left what We conferred on you of wealth behind your backs in the world without you having any choice; and — it is said to them in rebuke — We do not see with you your intercessors the idols whom you claimed to be associates of God amongst you that is in deserving your worship; it has been severed between you that is to say your bond has been dissolved a variant reading for baynukum ‘your union’ has baynakum ‘between you’ making it an adverbial qualifier that is the bond ‘between you’ has been severed’ and that intercession of theirs which you claimed in the world has failed abandoned you’.
Cattle,6,95,"Lo! Allah (it is) Who splitteth the grain of corn and the date- stone (for sprouting). He bringeth forth the living from the dead, and is the bringer-forth of the dead from the living. Such is Allah. How then are ye perverted ?",God it is Who splits the grain from the plants and the date-stone from the palm-trees. He brings forth the living from the dead such as the human being from the sperm and the bird from the egg; and is the Bringer-forth of the dead the sperm and the egg from the living. That Splitter and Bringer-forth is God. How then are you deluded? so how then are you turned away from faith despite the proof being established?

That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Wise.",He is the Cleaver of the daybreak al-isbāh is the verbal noun meaning al-subh ‘dawn’ in other words He splits the morning shaft the first light that appears after the darkness of night and He has appointed the night for stillness in which creatures rest from toil and the sun and the moon read both in the accusative wa’l-shamsa wa’l-qamara as a supplement to the syntactical status of al-layla ‘the night’ for reckoning for the calculation of periods of time or if the prefixed preposition bā’ is considered to have been omitted bi-husbān making it husbān a circumstantial qualifier referring to an implied verb such as yajriyān ‘they follow courses’ that is ‘they follow courses precisely calculated bi-husbān’ as is stated in the verse of sūrat al-Rahmān Q. 555.That mentioned is the ordaining of the Mighty in His kingdom the Knowing of His creation.
Cattle,6,97,And He it is Who hath set for you the stars that ye may guide your course by them amid the darkness of the land and the sea. We have detailed Our revelations for a people who have knowledge.,And He it is Who appointed for you the stars that you may guide your course by them amid the darkness of land and sea when travelling. Verily We have distinguished We have elucidated the signs the proofs of Our power for a people who have knowledge a people who reflect.

Surely in all that are signs proofs of His power exalted be He to resurrect and to do all other things for a people who believe it is these people that are specifically mentioned because they are the ones to profit from those signs by their believing in them in contrast to the disbelievers.
Cattle,6,100,"Yet they ascribe as partners unto Him the jinn, although He did create them, and impute falsely, without knowledge, sons and daughters unto Him.

There is no god but Him the Creator of all things. So worship Him affirm His Oneness. And He is Guardian over He is Keeper of all things.
Cattle,6,103,"Vision comprehendeth Him not, but He comprehendeth (all) vision. He is the Subtile, the Aware.",Vision cannot attain Him that is they the eyes cannot see Him — this is a denial that applies in particular circumstances since it is accepted that the believer will see Him in the Hereafter as indicated by God’s words On that Day faces shall be radiant gazing upon their Lord Q. 7522f. and by the hadīth of the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim ‘Verily you shall see your Lord as clearly as you see the full moon at night’ — and it is also said to mean that it vision cannot encompass Him; but He attains all vision that is to say He perceives them whereas they cannot perceive Him; it is not possible in the case of anyone other than Him to attain all vision while it vision cannot attain Him or encompass Him in knowledge. And He is the Subtle in dealing with His friends the Aware of them.

Cattle,6,106,Follow that which is inspired in thee from thy Lord; there is no God save Him; and turn away from the idolaters.,Follow what has been revealed to you from your Lord namely the Qur’ān. There is no god but Him; and turn away from the idolaters.

So in the same way that We have adorned for these that which they practise We have adorned for every community their good and evil deeds and they commit them; then to their Lord they shall return in the Hereafter and He will tell them what they used to do and requite them for it.
Cattle,6,109,And they swear a solemn oath by Allah that if there come unto them a portent they will believe therein. Say; Portents are with Allah and (so is) that which telleth you that if such came unto them they would not believe.,They that is the disbelievers of Mecca have sworn by God the most earnest oaths that if there came to them a sign of what they requested they will believe in it. Say to them ‘Signs are only with God’ and He sends them down as and when He wills; I am but a warner. But what will make you realise? how would you know if they have believed if these signs did come to them? In other words you would not know this; truly when they come they will not believe because of what I already know a variant reading for lā yu’minūna ‘they will not believe’ has lā tu’minūna ‘you will not believe’ making the address to the disbelievers; another variant reading has annahā instead of innahā ‘that truly’ as meaning la‘alla ‘that perhaps’ or as governed by the preceding clause la’in jā’athum āyatun ‘if there came to them a sign’.
Cattle,6,110,"We confound their hearts and their eyes. As they believed not therein at the first, We let them wander blindly on in their contumacy.",And We shall confound their hearts We shall turn their hearts away from the truth so that they cannot understand it and their eyes away from it so that they do not see it and thus do not believe; just as they did not believe in it that is in the verses that have been revealed the first time; and We shall leave them in their insolence in their misguidance wandering blindly hesitating perplexed.
Cattle,6,111,"And though We should send down the angels unto them, and the dead should speak unto them, and We should gather against them all things in array, they would not believe unless Allah so willed. Howbeit, most of them are ignorant.",And if We had sent down the angels to them and the dead had spoken with them as they have requested and We had gathered against them all things in droves read qubulan plural of qabīl meaning ‘throng upon throng’ or read qibalan meaning ‘before their very eyes’ and they were witness to your truthfulness yet they would not have believed as God already knows unless God willed that they believe and they did; but most of them are ignorant of this.
Cattle,6,112,"Thus have We appointed unto every prophet an adversary - devils of humankind and jinn who inspire in one another plausible discourse through guile. If thy Lord willed, they would not do so; so leave them alone with their devising;",And so We have appointed to every Prophet an enemy just as We have appointed these your enemies and this ‘adūwwan ‘an enemy’ is substituted by the following shayātīn ‘devils’ devils the rebels of mankind and jinn who inspire whisper fine speech to each other the falsehood that is disguised as such fine speech in delusion that is in order to delude them; yet had your Lord willed they would never have done it that mutual inspiration. So leave them let the disbelievers be with what they fabricate of disbelief and otherwise of what has been adorned for them — this was revealed before the command to fight them.
Cattle,6,113,"That the hearts of those who believe not in the Hereafter may incline thereto, and that they may take pleasure therein, and that they may earn what they are earning.",And that the hearts of those who do not believe in the Hereafter may incline to it wa-li-tasghā is a supplement to the above ghurūran ‘in delusion’ that is to that fine speech and that they may be pleased with it and that they may acquire earn what they are acquiring of sins and be punished for it.
Cattle,6,114,"Shall I seek other than Allah for judge, when He it is Who hath revealed unto you (this) Scripture, fully explained ? Those unto whom We gave the Scripture (aforetime) know that it is revealed from thy Lord in truth. So be not thou (O Muhammad) of the waverers.",The following was revealed when they asked the Prophet s to appoint an arbiter between him and themselves. Say Shall I seek demand other than God as a judge an arbiter between you and me when it is He Who revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān clearly explained? wherein truth is distinguished from falsehood. Those to whom We have given the Scripture the Torah the likes of ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions know that it is revealed read munzal or munazzal from your Lord in truth; so do not be of the waverers the doubters regarding it this is intended to affirm to the disbelievers that it is the truth.
Cattle,6,115,"Perfected is the Word of thy Lord in truth and justice. There is naught that can change His words. He is the Hearer, the Knower.",Perfected is the word of your Lord in the way of rulings and appointed terms in truthfulness and justice sidqan wa-‘adlan is for specification; none can change His words either by contravening His rulings or evading His appointed terms. He is the Hearing of what is said the Knowing of what is done.
Cattle,6,116,"If thou obeyedst most of those on earth they would mislead thee far from Allah’s way. They follow naught but an opinion, and they do but guess.",If you obey most of those on earth that is the disbelievers they will lead you astray from the way of God from His religion; they follow only supposition when they dispute with you concerning the status of carrion saying ‘What God has killed is more worthy of your consumption than what you kill yourselves!’; they are merely guessing speaking falsehood in this matter.
Cattle,6,117,"Lo! thy Lord, He knoweth best who erreth from His way; and He knoweth best (who are) the rightly guided.",Your Lord knows best those who stray from His way and He knows well the rightly guided and will requite both of them.
Cattle,6,118,"Eat of that over which the name of Allah hath been mentioned, if ye are believers in His revelations.",So eat from that over which God’s Name has been invoked that is that which has been sacrificed to His Name if you believe in His signs.
Cattle,6,119,"How should ye not eat of that over which the name of Allah hath been mentioned, when He hath explained unto you that which is forbidden unto you unless ye are compelled thereto. But lo! many are led astray by their own lusts through ignorance. Lo! thy Lord, He is Best Aware of the transgressors.",What is wrong with you that you do not eat from that over which God’s Name has been invoked of sacrifices when He has detailed for both verbs read the passive fussila ‘it has been detailed’ and hurrima ‘that which has been forbidden’ or the active fassala ‘He has detailed’ and harrama ‘what He has forbidden’ for you what He has forbidden in the verse Forbidden to you is carrion … Q. 53 except that to which you are compelled? thereof which is also lawful for you. The meaning is there is nothing to prevent you from eating what has been mentioned for He has explained to you what is forbidden for consumption and that over which God’s Name has been invoked is not among these forbidden things. But truly many are led astray read la-yadillūna ‘many are led astray’ or la-yudillūna ‘many lead others astray’ by their whims by what their own selves fancy in the way of permitting the consumption of carrion and otherwise without any knowledge with which to support their claims. Truly your Lord knows the transgressors those who overstep the bounds of what is lawful into what is unlawful.
Cattle,6,120,Forsake the outwardness of sin and the inwardness thereof. Lo! those who garner sin will be awarded that which they have earned.,And forsake leave outward aspect of sin and its inward aspect that is what is overt of it and what is secret — it is said that ‘sin’ here means fornication or it is said any act of disobedience; surely those who earn sin shall be requited in the Hereafter for what they used to perpetrate what they used to earn.
Cattle,6,121,"And eat not of that whereon Allah’s name hath not been mentioned, for lo! it is abomination. Lo! the devils do inspire their minions to dispute with you. But if ye obey them, ye will be in truth idolaters.",And do not eat from that over which God’s Name has not been invoked where it has died or been sacrificed to other than His Name — otherwise what a Muslim sacrifices and does not invoke God’s Name over whether intentionally or forgetfully is lawful as was stated by Ibn ‘Abbās and this is the opinion of al-Shāfi‘ī — verily it the eating thereof is wickedness a contravention of what is lawful. And truly the devils inspire whisper to their friends the disbelievers to dispute with you in deeming carrion lawful; and if you obey them in this matter you are truly idolaters.
Cattle,6,122,"Is he who was dead and We have raised him unto life, and set for him a light wherein he walketh among men, as him whose similitude is in utter darkness whence he cannot emerge ? Thus is their conduct made fairseeming for the disbelievers.",The following was revealed regarding Abū Jahl and others Why is he who was dead through unbelief and We gave him life through guidance and appointed for him a light by which to walk among people distinguishing thereby the truth from falsehood — this light being faith — as him whose likeness ka-man mathaluhu mathal ‘likeness’ is extra; in other words read ka-man huwa ‘as him who’ is in darkness whence he cannot emerge? — and this is the disbeliever — No! So in the same way that faith has been adorned for believers what the disbelievers have been doing in the way of disbelief and acts of disobedience has been adorned for them.
Cattle,6,123,"And thus have We made in every city great ones of its wicked ones, that they should plot therein. They do but plot against themselves, though they perceive not.",And thus in the same way that We have made the wicked folk of Mecca its leaders We have made in every city its sinners great ones that they may plot therein to impede the faith; but they plot only against themselves because the evil consequences thereof will befall them though they do not perceive this.
Cattle,6,124,"And when a token cometh unto them, they say: We will not believe till we are given that which Allah’s messengers are given. Allah knoweth best with whom to place His message. Humiliation from Allah and heavy punishment will smite the guilty for their scheming.",And when a sign of the truth of the Prophet s comes to them the people of Mecca they say ‘We will not believe in him until we are given the like of what God’s messengers were given’ in the way of a message and inspiration to us because we are wealthier and more senior in years. God exalted be He says God knows best where to place His Message read plural risālātihi ‘His Messages’ or singular risālatahu ‘His Message’; hayth ‘where’ constitutes the direct object because of the verb ya‘lam ‘He knows’ implicit in a‘lam ‘the best knower’ that is to say He knows the right place for it to be placed in and He thus places it there — these people however are not worthy of it. Humiliation from God and a terrible chastisement shall smite those who have sinned by saying this for their plotting.
Cattle,6,125,"And whomsoever it is Allah’s will to guide, He expandeth his bosom unto the Surrender, and whomsoever it is His Will to send astray, He maketh his bosom close and narrow as if he were engaged in sheer ascent. Thus Allah layeth ignominy upon those who believe not.",Whomever God desires to guide He expands his breast to Islam by casting into his heart a light which it the heart expands for and accepts as reported in a hadīth; and whomever He God desires to send astray He makes his breast narrow read dayqan or dayyiqan unable to accept it and constricted extremely tight read harijan ‘constricted’ as an adjective or harajan as a verbal noun by which it the heart of the misguided one is described hyperbolically as if he were engaged in ascent yassa‘‘ad is also read as yassā‘ad in both forms the original tā’ has been assimilated with the sād; a third variant reading has yas‘ad to the heaven when he is charged with the obligations of the faith because of the hardship for him therein. So like this making of the breast narrow God casts ignominy chastisement or He casts Satan that is He gives him authority over those who do not believe.
Cattle,6,126,"This is the path of thy Lord, a straight path. We have detailed Our revelations for a people who take heed.",And this path that you follow O Muhammad (s) is the path of your Lord a straight one with no crookedness therein mustaqīman ‘straight’ is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier emphasising the previous statement and it is operated by the import of the demonstrative noun hādhā ‘this’. We have detailed We have elucidated the signs for a people who remember yadhdhakkarūn the original tā’ has been assimilated with the dhāl that is to say a people who heed admonition — such people are singled out for mention because they are the ones to profit from the signs.
Cattle,6,127,For them is the abode of peace with their Lord. He will be their Protecting Friend because of what they used to do.,Theirs will be the abode of peace namely Paradise with their Lord and He will be their Friend because of what they used to do.
Cattle,6,128,"In the day when He will gather them together (He will say): O ye assembly of the jinn! Many of humankind did ye seduce. And their adherents among humankind will say: Our Lord! We enjoyed one another, but now we have arrived at the appointed term which Thou appointedst for us. He will say: Fire is your home. Abide therein for ever, save him whom Allah willeth (to deliver). Lo! thy Lord is Wise, Aware.",And mention the day when He God shall gather them yahshuruhum may also read nahshuruhum ‘We shall gather them’ that is creatures all together and it will be said to them ‘O assembly of jinn you have garnered much of mankind’ by your misleading them. Then their friends those who obeyed them from among mankind will say ‘Our Lord we enjoyed one another mankind enjoyed what the jinn adorned for them of passions while the jinn enjoyed mankind’s obedience to them; but now we have arrived at the term which You have appointed for us’ that is the Day of Resurrection — this statement expresses extreme regret on their part. He exalted be He will say to them by the tongues of the angels ‘The Fire is your lodging your abode to abide therein’ — except what God wills of those times when they will exit from it in order to drink boiling water which is located outside it as God exalted be He has said Then they shall return to the Hell-fire Q. 3768; according to Ibn ‘Abbās this proviso pertains to those whom God knows will believe mā ‘what’ thus has the sense of man ‘whom’. Surely your Lord is Wise in His actions Knowing of His creatures.
Cattle,6,129,Thus We let some of the wrong-doers have power over others because of what they are wont to earn.,So just as We let the rebels from among mankind and jinn enjoy one another We let some of the evildoers have power over others because of what they are wont to earn of acts of disobedience.
Cattle,6,130,O ye assembly of the jinn and humankind! Came there not unto you messengers of your own who recounted unto you My tokens and warned you of the meeting of this your Day ? They will say: We testify against ourselves. And the life of the world beguiled them. And they testify against themselves that they were disbelievers.,‘O assembly of jinn and mankind did not messengers come to you from among you that is from among both of your number — which holds true in the case of mankind since messengers came from among them or by ‘messengers’ if the jinn are meant those messengers among the jinn who are their warners the ones who listen to the speech of the human messengers and convey it to their kind — to recount to you My signs and to warn you of the encounter of this Day of yours?’ They shall say ‘We bear witness against ourselves’ that all this was conveyed to us. God exalted be He says And the life of this world deluded them and so they did not believe. And they bear witness against themselves that they were disbelievers.
Cattle,6,131,This is because thy Lord destroyeth not the townships arbitrarily while their people are unconscious (of the wrong they do).,That sending of the messengers is because an phonetically lightened with the lām of li-annahu implied thus read as li-annahu ‘because’ your Lord would never destroy the towns through injustice on their part while their inhabitants were heedless not having had any Messenger to make things clear to them.
Cattle,6,132,For all there will be ranks from what they did. Thy Lord is not unaware of what they do.,All of those who perform deeds shall have degrees of requital according to what they have done of good or evil. Your Lord is not heedless of what they do ya‘malūna may also be read ta‘malūna ‘you do’.
Cattle,6,133,"Thy Lord is the Absolute, the Lord of Mercy. If He will, He can remove you and can cause what He will to follow after you, even as He raised you from the seed of other folk.",Your Lord is Independent of His creatures and their worship the Lord of Mercy. If He will He can remove you O people of Mecca by destroying you and leave whom He will of creatures to succeed after you just as He produced you from the seed of another folk whom He removed; but He has spared you as a mercy to you.
Cattle,6,134,"Lo! that which ye are promised will surely come to pass, and ye cannot escape.",Truly that which you are promised of the Hour and chastisement will surely come to pass inevitably and you cannot escape you cannot elude Our chastisement.
Cattle,6,135,Say (O Muhammad): O my people! Work according to your power. Lo! I too am working. Thus ye will come to know for which of us will be the happy sequel. Lo! the wrong-doers will not be successful.,Say to them ‘O my people act according to your state your circumstances; truly I am acting according to my circumstances. And assuredly you will know whose man the relative particle introducing the object of the verb ‘you will know’ sequel shall be the abode that is who shall have the praiseworthy sequel in the abode of the Hereafter will it be us or yourselves? Surely the evildoers the disbelievers will not prosper’ will not find happiness.
Cattle,6,136,"They assign unto Allah, of the crops and cattle which He created, a portion, and they say: ""This is Allah’s"" - in their make-believe - ""and this is for (His) partners in regard to us."" Thus that which (they assign) unto His partners in them reacheth not Allah and that which (they assign) unto Allah goeth to their (so-called) partners. Evil is their ordinance.",They the disbelievers of Mecca assign to God of the tillage the crops and the cattle which He multiplied He created a portion which they dispense to visitors and the needy and to their associates belongs a portion which they dispense to such keepers of the tillage and cattle saying ‘This is for God’ — so they assert read bi-za‘mihim or bi-zu‘mihim — ‘and this is for our associates’ and if any of the portion of these associates fell into God’s portion they used to restore it to that of their associates but when something of His portion fell into theirs they would leave it there saying ‘God is Independent and is not in need of this’ as God exalted be He says So that which is intended for their associates does not reach God and that which is intended for God does reach their associates. Evil is that provision of theirs which they decree!
Cattle,6,137,"Thus have their (so-called) partners (of Allah) made the killing of their children to seem fair unto many of the idolaters, that they may ruin them and make their faith obscure for them. Had Allah willed (it otherwise), they had not done so. So leave them alone with their devices.",And thus in the same way that what is mentioned was adorned for them those associates of theirs from among the jinn have adorned for many of the idolaters the slaying of their children by burying them alive shurakā’uhum ‘those associates of theirs’ is read in the nominative as the subject of the verb zayyana ‘adorned’; an alternative reading has the passive zuyyina ‘it has been adorned’ with qatlu ‘the slaying’ in the nominative as the subject of this passive verb awlādahum ‘their children’ in the accusative on account of it being the direct object of qatlu ‘the slaying’ and shurakā’ihim in the genitive as an annexation to qatlu so that the object in this case intervenes between the two elements of the annexation qatlu awlādahum shurakā’ihim ‘their associates killing the children’ — this is acceptable syntactically — and the annexation of qatlu to shurakā’ihim in this latter reading is on account of them the associates commanding the idolaters to do this that they may destroy them and to confuse to make obscure their religion for them. Had God willed they would not have done so; so leave them and that which they fabricate.
Cattle,6,138,"And they say: Such cattle and crops are forbidden. No-one is to eat of them save whom we will - in their make-believe - cattle whose backs are forbidden, cattle over which they mention not the name of Allah. (All that is) a lie against Him. He will repay them for that which they invent.",They say ‘These cattle and tillage are sacrosanct forbidden. No one is to eat of them except whom we will’ from among the retainers of the graven images and others — so they assert in other words they have no convincing argument for it — ‘and cattle whose backs have been forbidden and cannot therefore be ridden such as the camels they call Sā’ibas or Hāmīs and cattle over which they do not invoke the Name of God’ when they slaughter them invoking instead the names of their idols ascribing such rules to God; forging lies against Him. He will assuredly requite them for what they used to fabricate against Him.
Cattle,6,139,"And they say: That which is in the bellies of such cattle is reserved for our males and is forbidden to our wives; but if it be born dead, then they (all) may be partakers thereof. He will reward them for their attribution (of such ordinances unto Him). Lo, He is Wise, Aware.",And they say ‘That which is within the bellies of these forbidden cattle namely the camels they call Sā’ibas or Bahīras is reserved permitted for our males and forbidden to our spouses that is the women; but if it be dead read maytatun or maytatan and the verb as either feminine takun or masculine yakun ‘if it be’ then they all may be partakers thereof’. He God will assuredly requite them for their describing this and that as either permitted or forbidden with the appropriate requital thereof. Surely He is Wise in His actions Knowing of His creatures.
Cattle,6,140,"They are losers who besottedly have slain their children without knowledge, and have forbidden that which Allah bestowed upon them, inventing a lie against Allah. They indeed have gone astray and are not guided.",They are losers who slay read qatalū or qattalū their children by burying them alive in folly out of ignorance without knowledge and have forbidden what God has provided them of what has been mentioned in calumny against God. Verily they have gone astray and are not guided.
Cattle,6,141,"He it is Who produceth gardens trellised and untrellised, and the date-palm, and crops of divers flavour, and the olive and the pomegranate, like and unlike.

Allah loveth not the prodigals.",And He it is Who produces creates gardens orchards trellised extending along the ground as in the case of watermelons and untrellised rising upwards on a stem such as palm-trees; and He produces palm-trees and crops diverse in flavour diverse in the shape and savour of its fruit and seed and olives and pomegranates alike in terms of their leaf mutashābihan ‘alike’ is a circumstantial qualifier and unlike in terms of their savour. Eat of the fruit thereof when it ripens before its maturity passes and pay the due thereof the alms as appropriate on the day of its harvest read yawma hasādahu or yawma hasādihi that is one tenth or half of it and do not be prodigal by giving it all away so that nothing remains for the consumption of your dependants. Truly God does not love the prodigal who overstep the bounds of that which He has delimited for them.
Cattle,6,142,"And of the cattle (He produceth) some for burdens, some for food. Eat of that which Allah hath bestowed upon you, and follow not the footsteps of the devil, for lo! he is an open foe to you.",And He produces of the cattle some for burden fit to bear loads such as the large mature camels and some for light support not fit for these load-bearing tasks such as young camels or sheep such cattle are called farsh because they are like ‘bedding farsh spread on the ground’ on account of their physical closeness to it; eat of that which God has provided you and do not follow the steps of Satan his methods of forbidding things or deeming them lawful. Surely he is a manifest foe to you one whose enmity is evident.
Cattle,6,143,"Eight pairs: Of the sheep twain, and of the goats twain. Say: Hath He forbidden the two males or the two females, or that which the wombs of the two females contain ? Expound to me (the case) with knowledge, if ye are truthful.",Eight pairs types thamāniyata azwājin substitutes for hamūlatan wa-farshan ‘some for burdens and some for light support’ two of sheep a male and a female; and of goats read ma‘az or ma‘z two. Say O Muhammad (s) to those who on one occasion deem male cattle forbidden and on another the females thereof and then ascribe such rules to God ‘Is it the two males of the sheep and goats He has forbidden you or the two females of these two types or that which the wombs of the two females contain be they male or female? Inform Me with knowledge of the details of such prohibitions if you speak truly’ in this matter meaning on what basis has the prohibition been made? If it is on the basis of maleness then all males are forbidden; if on the basis of femaleness then all females are so forbidden; if on what the womb may contain then both genders are prohibited. So on what basis are such specifications made? the interrogative is meant as a repudiation.
Cattle,6,144,"And of the camels twain and of the oxen twain. Say: Hath He forbidden the two males or the two females, or that which the wombs of the two females contain; or were ye by to witness when Allah commanded you (all) this ? Then who doth greater wrong than he who deviseth a lie concerning Allah, that he may lead mankind astray without knowledge. Lo!

Then who that is none does greater evil than he who invents a lie against God in this matter that he may lead mankind astray without any knowledge? Truly God does not guide evildoing folk’.
Cattle,6,145,"Say: I find not in that which is revealed unto me aught prohibited to an eater that he eat thereof, except it be carrion, or blood poured forth, or swineflesh - for that verily is foul - or the abomination which was immolated to the name of other than Allah.

But whoever is constrained to do any of what has been mentioned and he consumes it neither coveting nor transgressing then surely your Lord is Forgiving to him for what he has consumed Merciful’ towards him. To these prohibited things the Sunna adds all beasts of prey with canine teeth and birds of prey with talons.
Cattle,6,146,"Unto those who are Jews We forbade every animal with claws. And of the oxen and the sheep forbade We unto them the fat thereof save that upon the backs or the entrails, or that which is mixed with the bone. That we awarded them for their rebellion.

Cattle,6,147,"So if they give the lie to thee (Muhammad), say: Your Lord is a Lord of All-Embracing Mercy, and His wrath will never be withdrawn from guilty folk.",So if they deny you with regard to what you have brought then say to them ‘Your Lord has all-embracing mercy for He does not hasten to bring about your punishment — herein is a gentle summoning of them to the faith; and His might His chastisement when it comes will never be driven back from the sinning folk’.
Cattle,6,148,"They who are idolaters will say: Had Allah willed, we had not ascribed (unto Him) partners neither had our fathers, nor had we forbidden aught.

Lo! ye follow naught but an opinion, Lo! ye do but guess.",The idolaters will say ‘Had God willed we would not have been idolaters neither we nor our fathers nor would we have forbidden anything’ in other words our idolatry and our forbidding of things are by His will and so He must be satisfied with it. God exalted be He says So in the same way that these have lied those who were before them gave the lie to their prophets until they tasted Our might Our chastisement. Say ‘Have you any knowledge that God is satisfied with this such that you can adduce for us? that is you have no such knowledge. You follow only supposition in this matter merely guessing’ telling lies therein.
Cattle,6,149,Say - For Allah’s is the final argument - Had He willed He could indeed have guided all of you.,Say if you have no definitive argument then ‘To God belongs the conclusive argument the perfect one for had He willed to guide you He could have guided all of you’.
Cattle,6,150,"Say: Come, bring your witnesses who can bear witness that Allah forbade (all) this. And if they bear witness, do not thou bear witness with them.

Hath not the covenant of the Scripture been taken on their behalf that they should not speak aught concerning Allah save the truth ? And they have studied that which is therein. And the abode of the Hereafter is better, for those who ward off (evil). Have ye then no sense ?",And there succeeded after them a generation who inherited the Scripture the Torah from their forefathers choosing the transient things of this inferior life that is the ephemeral aspects of this lowly thing that the world is in the way of what is lawful and what is unlawful and saying ‘It will be forgiven us’ what we have done; and yet if similar transient things were to come to them they would take them wa-in ya’tihim ‘aradun mithluhu ya’khudhūhu this sentence is a circumstantial qualifier in other words they hope for forgiveness whilst committing the same offence again and persisting in it and in the Torah there is no such promise about forgiveness for persistence in sin. Has not the covenant of the Scripture mīthāqu l-kitābi the annexation functions in place of fī ‘in’ sc. ‘the covenant in the Scripture’ been taken a-lam yu’khadh ‘has it not been taken’ is an interrogative meant as an affirmative from them that they should not say about God anything but the truth? And they have studied wa-darasū is a supplement to yu’khadh ‘has it not been taken?’ they have read what is in it so why do they impute lies to it the Scripture by ascribing to it the idea of forgiveness for persistence in sin? And the Abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are wary of what is unlawful. Do they not understand? ya‘qilūn may also be read as ta‘qilūn ‘do you not understand?’ that it is better and so prefer it to the abode of this world?
The Heights,7,170,"And as for those who make (men) keep the Scripture, and establish worship - lo! We squander not the wages of reformers.",And those who adhere read yumassikūn or yumsikūn to the Scripture from among them and have established prayer the likes of ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and his companions verily We shall not let the wages of reformers go to waste innā lā nudī‘u ajra l-muslihīn the sentence is the predicate of alladhīna ‘those who’; also there is here the replacing of the third person pronominalisation alladhīna ‘those who’ with an overt noun al-muslihīna ‘reformers’ in other words their wages.
The Heights,7,171,"And when We shook the Mount above them as it were a covering, and they supposed that it was going to fall upon them (and We said): Hold fast that which We have given you, and remember that which is therein, that ye may ward off (evil).",And mention when We wrenched the mountain above them We lifted it up unearthing it from its root as if it were a canopy and they thought they were certain that it was about to fall upon them because of God’s threat to them that it would fall upon them if they refused to accept the rulings contained in the Torah they had initially refused to accept them because of their being burdensome but then accepted them and We said to them ‘Take firmly seriously and earnestly what We have given you and remember what is in it by acting in accordance with it that you might be God-fearing’.
The Heights,7,172,"And (remember) when thy Lord brought forth from the Children of Adam, from their reins, their seed, and made them testify of themselves, (saying): Am I not your Lord ? They said: Yea, verily. We testify. (That was) lest ye should say at the Day of Resurrection: Lo! of this we were unaware;",And remember when your Lord took from the Children of Adam from their loins min zuhūrihim is an inclusive substitution for the preceding clause min banī Ādama ‘from the Children of Adam’ with the same preposition min ‘from’ their seed by bringing forth one from the loins of the other all from the loins of Adam offspring after offspring in the way that they multiply looking like small ants at the valley of Na‘mān on the Day of ‘Arafa because of their multitude. God set up proofs of His Lordship for them and endowed them with the faculty of reason and made them testify against themselves saying ‘Am I not your Lord?’ They said ‘Yea indeed You are our Lord we testify’ to this and this taking of testimony is lest they should say in both instances read third person yaqūlū ‘they say’ or second person taqūlū ‘you say’ on the Day of Resurrection ‘Truly of this Oneness of God we were unaware’ not knowing it!
The Heights,7,173,Or lest ye should say: (It is) only (that) our fathers ascribed partners to Allah of old and we were (their) seed after them. Wilt Thou destroy us on account of that which those who follow falsehood did ?,Or lest you should say ‘It is merely that our fathers were idolaters before that is before our time and we were descendants of theirs and so we followed their example. Will You then destroy us chastise us for that which those who follow falsehood did?’ from among our forefathers by their establishing idolatry? The meaning is they cannot use such arguments when they have been made to testify before their very selves to God’s Oneness. To effect this reminder by the tongue of the bearer of the miracle Muhammad (s) equally serves as a reminder for every soul to remember this within itself.
The Heights,7,174,"Thus we detail the revelations, that haply they may return.",Thus We detail the signs We explain them even as We have explained the covenant that they might reflect on them and that they might revert from their disbelief.

Bā‘ūrā’ a scholar from among the Children of Israel who had been given some knowledge of the Scriptures and who was asked by them to invoke God against Moses. And when he did the invocation turned against him and his tongue fell out onto his chest and Satan pursued him catching up with him and so he became his comrade and he became of the perverse.
The Heights,7,176,"And had We willed We could have raised him by their means, but he clung to the earth and followed his own lust. Therefor his likeness is as the likeness of a dog: if thou attackest him he panteth with his tongue out, and if thou leavest him he panteth with his tongue out. Such is the likeness of the people who deny Our revelations. Narrate unto them the history (of the men of old), that haply they may take thought.",And had We willed We would have raised him up to the ranks of the scholars thereby by facilitating his way to good deeds; but he was disposed to at peace in the earth — that is this world — and inclined to it and followed his whims by calling others to them and so We abased him. Therefore his likeness his description is as the likeness of a dog if you attack it by driving it away or curbing it it lolls its tongue out and if you leave it it lolls its tongue out and no other animal is like it in this way both conditional sentences constitute a circumstantial qualifier that is to say it has its tongue lolling out despicably in all circumstances. The purpose here is to point out the similarity between the one who follows his whims and a dog in terms of condition and vileness judging by the contextualising fā’ of fa-mathaluhu ‘therefore his likeness’ which relates what comes after it to what came before it in the way of ‘inclining towards this world and following whims’ and judging by God’s saying That likeness is the likeness of those people who deny Our signs. So recount the tale to the Jews that they might reflect upon it and so believe.
The Heights,7,177,"Evil as an example are the folk who denied Our revelations, and were wont to wrong themselves.",Evil as an example are the people evil is the example of the people who denied Our signs and were wont to wrong themselves through denial.

These are the neglectful.",And We have indeed urged unto Hell many of the jinn and mankind having hearts wherewith they do not understand the truth and having eyes wherewith they do not perceive the proofs of God’s power with a perception that entails reflection and having ears wherewith they do not hear the signs or the admonitions in a way so as to reflect and take heed. These they are like cattle in their failure to understand perceive or listen — nay rather they are further astray than cattle because at least they cattle seek what is beneficial to them and stay away from what is harmful to them these individuals on the other hand are proceeding towards the Fire out of sheer obstinacy. These — they are the heedless.

They will be requited what they do.,And to God belong the ninety nine Most Beautiful Names — mentioned in hadīth — al-husnā is the feminine for al-ahsan so invoke name Him by them and leave those who blaspheme His Names yulhidūn ‘they blaspheme’ from fourth form alhada or first form lahada meaning ‘those who incline away from the truth’ by deriving from them names for their gods as in the case of al-Lāt from Allāh ‘God’ al-‘Uzzā from al-‘Azīz ‘Mighty’ and Manāt from al-Mannān ‘Lord of Favours’.

In what fact after this will they believe ?",And have they not reflected upon the dominion the kingdom malakūt is mulk of the heaven and of the earth and upon what things God has created min shay’in is an explication of the preceding mā ‘what’ so that they are able to infer the power of their Creator and His Oneness and upon that upon the fact that it may be that their term is already near so that they might hasten to believe lest they die as disbelievers and move towards the Fire?

Say to them ‘The knowledge of when it shall be is only with my Lord. He alone shall reveal it manifest it at its proper time li-waqtihā the lām here functions as fī ‘at’. It weighs heavily tremendously in the heavens and the earth upon their inhabitants because of its awesomeness. It will not come on you save all of a sudden’. They will question you as if you were preoccupied with obsessed with inquiring about it such that you have come to acquire knowledge of it. Say ‘Knowledge of it is only with God innamā ‘ilmuhā ‘inda’Llāhi is for emphasis but most people do not know’ that knowledge of it lies with God exalted be He.

This affair was the result of Satan’s inspiration and his doings’ reported by al-Hākim who deemed it the report ‘sound’ sahīh and also reported by al-Tirmidhī who considered it ‘fair-uncommon’ hasan gharīb; but exalted is God above what they the people of Mecca associate in the way of idols this sentence is consequent a supplement to the one beginning with khalaqakum ‘He created you’ so that what comes between the two is a parenthetical statement.

Call on them now, and let them answer you, if ye are truthful!",Truly those on whom you call whom you worship besides God are servants owned like you; call them then and let them answer you your call if you are truthful in claiming that they are gods God then illustrates their utter incapacity and the superiority which their worshippers possess over them saying

The Heights,7,204,"And when the Qur’an is recited, give ear to it and pay heed, that ye may obtain mercy.",And when the Qur’ān is recited listen to it and pay heed refraining from speech so that you might find mercy this was revealed regarding the requirement of refraining from speech during the mosque sermon which here has been expressed by the recital of ‘the Qur’ān’ because it the sermon comprises it; others say that it was revealed regarding the requirement of silence and attention during the recitation of the Qur’ān in general.

It happened that Abū Sufyān was returning from Syria with a caravan. The Prophet s and his followers went forth to plunder it; but Quraysh became aware of this and so Abū Jahl and some Meccan fighters rode out to defend it — these constituted the ‘band’. Abū Sufyān drove the caravan via the coastal route and it managed to escape. Abū Jahl was then advised to return but he refused and marched on towards Badr. The Prophet s consulted with his followers saying to them ‘God has promised me one of the two parties’. So they agreed with him to attack the Meccan band but some of them were averse to this complaining ‘We have not come prepared for this!’ as God exalted be He says
Spoils of War,8,6,"Disputing with thee of the Truth after it had been made manifest, as if they were being driven to death visible.",They dispute with you concerning the truth the order to fight after it had become clear after it had become evident to them as though they were being driven to death while they looked at it death with their very eyes utterly averse to it.

Spoils of War,8,8,"That He might cause the Truth to triumph and bring vanity to naught, however much the guilty might oppose;",And that He might cause the truth to be realised and annul efface falsehood disbelief however much the sinners the idolaters were averse to that.

Spoils of War,8,12,"When thy Lord inspired the angels, (saying): I am with you. So make those who believe stand firm. I will throw fear into the hearts of those who disbelieve. Then smite the necks and smite of them each finger.",When your Lord inspired the angels with whom He reinforced the Muslims saying ‘I am with you with assistance and victorious help so make the believers stand firm by helping them and giving them good tidings. I shall cast terror fear into the hearts of the disbelievers; so smite above the necks that is the heads and smite of them every finger!’ that is smite the extremities of their hands and feet thus when one of them went to strike an disbeliever’s head it would roll off before his sword reached it. The Prophet s threw a handful of pebbles against them and every single idolater was struck in his eye and thus they were defeated.
Spoils of War,8,13,"That is because they opposed Allah and His messenger. Whoso opposeth Allah and His messenger, (for him) lo! Allah is severe in punishment.",That chastisement befalling them is because they had contended with they had opposed God and His Messenger whoever contends with God and with His Messenger surely God is severe in retribution against him.

Spoils of War,8,16,"Whoso on that day turneth his back to them, unless manoeuvring for battle or intent to join a company, he truly hath incurred wrath from Allah, and his habitation will be hell, a hapless journey’s end.",Whoever turns his back to them on that day the day of the encounter with them unless manœuvring turning around for battle — by pretending to be in flight as a trick while actually intending to relaunch an attack — or joining another detachment a company of Muslims calling on it for assistance he has truly incurred the wrath of God and his abode will be Hell — an evil journey’s end! an evil return it is. This threat applies so long as the numbers of disbelievers do not surpass twice that of the believers.
Spoils of War,8,17,"Ye (Muslims) slew them not, but Allah slew them. And thou (Muhammad) threwest not when thou didst throw, but Allah threw, that He might test the believers by a fair test from Him. Lo! Allah is Hearer, Knower.",You did not slay them at Badr by your own might but God slew them by giving you assistance and you threw not O Muhammad (s) against the eyes of the unbelieving folk when you threw the pebbles for a handful of pebbles thrown by a human being cannot strike the eyes of every person in a large troop but God threw by making that throw reach them. He did this in order to vanquish the disbelievers and that He might try the believers with a fair test a fair gift namely booty; surely God is Hearing of their sayings Knowing of their conditions.
Spoils of War,8,18,That (is the case); and (know) that Allah (it is) Who maketh weak the plan of disbelievers.,That is the true gift for you and know that God weakens the plan of the disbelievers.

The evil of their deeds is made fairseeming unto them. Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk.",Postponement of the sacred month — that is the deferment of the sacredness of a given month to another as they used to do during paganism such as postponing the sacredness of Muharram if it arrives while they are at war to Safar — is only an excess of unbelief because of their rejection of God’s ruling thereof whereby those who disbelieve are led astray yudallu may also be read yadillu ‘they go astray’ one year they make it the month postponed profane and hallow it another that they may make up by profaning one month and hallowing another in its place the number of months which God has hallowed such that they do not hallow more or less than the four months but without observing the individual months themselves; and so they profane what God has hallowed.

Still they will swear by God when you return to them saying ‘Had we been able to go forth we would have gone forth with you’ destroying their souls by swearing false oaths and God knows that they truly are liars in this saying of theirs.
Repentance,9,43,Allah forgive thee (O Muhammad)! Wherefor didst thou grant them leave ere those who told the truth were manifest to thee and thou didst know the liars ?,The Prophet s exercising his personal judgement had given leave to a group to stay behind and so the following was revealed as a reprimand for him but with the pardon first in order to reassure his heart May God pardon you!

Repentance,9,52,Say: Can ye await for us aught save one of two good things (death or victory in Allah’s way) ? while we await for you that Allah will afflict you with a doom from Him or at our hands. Await then! Lo! We are awaiting with you.,Say ‘Are you waiting tarabbasūn one of the two original tā’ letters in tatarabbasūn has been omitted for anything to occur for us but one of the two fair things the two fair outcomes? husnayayn is the dual form of husnā which is the feminine form of ahsan that is victory or martyrdom? We are waiting in your case too for God to afflict you with a chastisement from Him with a calamity from the heaven or at our hands should we be given permission to fight you. So wait for this to befall us we are also waiting with you’ your end.
Repentance,9,53,"Say: Pay (your contribution), willingly or unwillingly, it will not be accepted from you. Lo! ye were ever froward folk.",Say ‘Expend in obedience to God willingly or unwillingly it what you expend shall not be accepted from you; you are surely a wicked folk’ the imperative statement here also functions as a predicate.
Repentance,9,54,"And naught preventeth that their contributions should be accepted from them save that they have disbelieved in Allah and in His messenger, and they come not to worship save as idlers, and pay not (their contribution) save reluctantly.",And nothing prevents their expenditure from being accepted read as yuqbala or tuqbala from them but that they innahum is the subject of the verb while an tuqbala ‘being accepted’ constitutes the object have disbelieved in God and His Messenger and that they do not come to perform prayer save as idlers sluggishly and that they do not expend without their being reluctant to expend for they consider it a financial penalty.
Repentance,9,55,So let not their riches nor their children please thee (O Muhammad). Allah thereby intendeth but to punish them in the life of the world and that their souls shall pass away while they are disbelievers.,So do not let their wealth or their children please you that is do not deem fair Our graces to them for this is a way of drawing them on by degrees to punish them God only desires thereby to chastise them in the life of this world by way of the hardship that they encounter in amassing such wealth and children and the calamities they suffer as a result thereof; and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers so He punishes them in the Hereafter with the worst punishment.
Repentance,9,56,"And they swear by Allah that they are in truth of you, when they are not of you, but they are folk who are afraid.",And they swear by God that they truly are of you that is that they are believers; but they are not of you; they are a folk who are afraid that you should deal with them as you have done with the idolaters and so they swear merely in pretence in order to protect themselves.
Repentance,9,57,"Had they but found a refuge, or caverns, or a place to enter, they surely had resorted thither swift as runaways.",If they could find a shelter in which to seek refuge or some caverns underground chambers or any place to enter they would turn and bolt away to it they would hasten to enter it and get away from you with the undeterred speed of an indomitable steed.
Repentance,9,58,"And of them is he who defameth thee in the matter of the alms. If they are given thereof they are content, and if they are not given thereof, behold! they are enraged.",Some of them defame you concerning the apportioning of voluntary almsgivings; if they are given a share of them they are content but if they are given none then they are enraged.
Repentance,9,59,"(How much more seemly) had they been content with that which Allah and His messenger had given them and had said: Allah sufficeth us. Allah will give us of His bounty, and (also) His messenger. Unto Allah we are suppliants.",If only they had been content with what God and His Messenger have given them in the way of spoils and the like and had said ‘Sufficient for us is God; God will give us from His bounty and His Messenger will also give us from other spoils what will suffice us; to God we are suppliants’ that He enrich us the response of the conditional law ‘if only’ is la-kāna khayran lahum ‘it would have been better for them’.
Repentance,9,60,"The alms are only for the poor and the needy, and those who collect them, and those whose hearts are to be reconciled, and to free the captives and the debtors, and for the cause of Allah, and (for) the wayfarer; a duty imposed by Allah. Allah is Knower, Wise.",The voluntary almsgivings the alms to be dispensed are only for the poor who cannot find anything to suffice them in the least and the needy who cannot find anything to suffice them and those who work with them that is with these alms in other words the one who collects them the one who takes the oaths from those who claim them the slave to be manumitted by contract as well as the tax-summoner; and those whose hearts are to be reconciled so that they might become Muslims or that Islam might be firmly established or that their peers might become Muslims or that they might defend Muslims all of whom are classed according to different categories. According to al-Shāfi‘ī may God be pleased with him the first and the last of these categories are no longer given of the alms-tax today because of the established power of Islam; in contrast the other two categories are given of the alms-tax according to the sounder opinion; and for the manumission of slaves that is for slaves to be manumitted by contract and for the debtors those in debt if they have taken out a debt without intending thereby an act of disobedience or those who have repented but have nothing with which to fulfil the penalty of expiation or to set things right between people even if they be wealthy; and for the way of God that is for those who are engaged in the struggle of those for whom there is no share of the booty fay’ even if they be wealthy; and for the traveller the one cut off from resources during his journey — a duty imposed by God farīdatan ‘a duty’ is in the accusative because of an implied verb sc. faradahā ‘which He has imposed’. And God is Knower of His creatures Wise in His actions. Thus it is impermissible to dispense these alms-proceeds other than to these categories or to deny these proceeds to any one of these categories if they exist. The Imam must divide these proceeds among them equally but he is permitted to give priority to certain individuals over others within any one category. The lām of li’l-fuqarā’ ‘for the poor’ indicates that it is obligatory to include every individual of these categories in the distribution of the proceeds; it is not however obligatory to do so when the person in charge of the monies has to apportion it but finds that it is insufficient. Indeed in such a situation it suffices to give three individuals from each category but anything less than that is not sufficient as is indicated by the plural form. The Sunna shows that the prerequisite condition for receiving a share of such monies is that the person be a Muslim but not a Hashimī or a Muttālibī.
Repentance,9,61,"And of them are those who vex the Prophet and say: He is only a hearer. Say: A hearer of good for you, who believeth in Allah and is true to the believers, and a mercy for such of you as believe. Those who vex the messenger of Allah, for them there is a painful doom.",And of them the hypocrites are those who injure the Prophet by casting aspersions on him and communicating to others what he says in confidence saying when they are forbidden from doing this lest it should reach him ‘He is only a listener!’ that is he listens to anything that is said and accepts it so that when we swear to him that we have not communicated to others a particular thing he believes us. Say he is ‘A listener who listens to good for you and not one who listens to evil one who believes in God and has faith he trusts in the believers in what they inform him and not in others the lām of li’l-mu’minīna ‘in the believers’ has been added to distinguish between belief in the sense of ‘submitting to God’ islām and in other senses such as ‘trusting’ and who is a mercy read rahmatun in the nominative as a supplement to udhunun ‘a listener’ or rahmatin in the genitive as a supplement to khayrin ‘to good’ to those of you who believe. Those who injure God’s Messenger for them there is a painful chastisement’.
Repentance,9,62,"They swear by Allah to you (Muslims) to please you, but Allah, with His messenger, hath more right that they should please Him if they are believers.",They swear by God to you O believers that what has reached you of the Messenger being injured they did not do so that they might please you but God and His Messenger are more deserving that they should please them through obedience if they are true believers the merging of the pronouns into one in yurdūhu ‘their pleasing them’ is because the ‘pleasure’ of both God and His Messenger are mutually dependent; either that or it is because the predicate of Allāhu wa-rasūluhu ‘God and His Messenger’ has been omitted.
Repentance,9,63,"Know they not that whoso opposeth Allah and His messenger, his verily is fire of hell, to abide therein ? That is the extreme abasement.",Do they not know that the fact is that whoever opposes God and His Messenger for him shall be the fire of Hell as a requital to abide therein? That is the great abasement.
Repentance,9,64,"The hypocrites fear lest a surah should be revealed concerning them, proclaiming what is in their hearts. Say: Scoff (your fill)! Lo! Allah is disclosing what ye fear.",The hypocrites are cautious they fear lest a sūra should be revealed to them that is to the believers informing them of what is in their the hypocrites’ hearts of hypocrisy and yet despite this they persist in mockery. Say ‘Keep mocking! this is an imperative of threat God will bring out He will make manifest that hypocrisy of yours of which you are fearful’ lest it be brought out.
Repentance,9,65,And if thou ask them (O Muhammad) they will say: We did but talk and jest. Say: Was it at Allah and His revelations and His messenger that ye did scoff ?,And if la-in the lām is for oaths you question them about their mockery of you and of the Qur’ān while they were journeying with you towards Tabūk assuredly they will say making excuses ‘We were only engaging in idle talk and jesting’ in conversation in order to pass the time of the road and we did not mean it. Say to them ‘Were you then mocking God and His signs and His Messenger?
Repentance,9,66,"Make no excuse. Ye have disbelieved after your (confession of) belief. If We forgive a party of you, a party of you We shall punish because they have been guilty.",Make no excuses for that. You have disbelieved after believing that is your disbelief has become manifest even as you have manifested belief. If We forgive read passive yu‘fa ‘it is forgiven’ or active first person plural na‘fu ‘We forgive’ a party of you because of its sincerity and its repentance as in the case of Jahsh b. Humayyir We will chastise read either passive tu‘adhdhab ‘it shall be chastised’ or nu‘adhdhib another party because they were sinners’ persisting in hypocrisy and mockery.
Repentance,9,67,"The hypocrites, both men and women, proceed one from another. They enjoin the wrong, and they forbid the right, and they withhold their hands (from spending for the cause of Allah). They forget Allah, so He hath forgotten them. Lo! the hypocrites, they are the transgressors.",The hypocrites both men and women are of one another that is they resemble one another in religion as pieces of an individual entity they enjoin indecency unbelief and acts of disobedience and forbid decency faith and obedience; and they withhold their hands shut from expending in obedience of God; they have forgotten God they have abandoned obedience of Him so He has forgotten them He has deprived them of His grace. Truly the hypocrites they are the wicked.
Repentance,9,68,"Allah promiseth the hypocrites, both men and women, and the disbelievers fire of hell for their abode. It will suffice them. Allah curseth them, and theirs is lasting torment.",God has promised the hypocrites both men and women and the disbelievers the fire of Hell to abide therein it will suffice them as a requital and a punishment. And God has cursed them He has removed them from His mercy and theirs will be a lasting perpetual chastisement.
Repentance,9,69,"Even as those before you who were mightier than you in strength, and more affluent than you in wealth and children. They enjoyed their lot awhile, so ye enjoy your lot awhile even as those before you did enjoy their lot awhile. And ye prate even as they prated. Such are they whose works have perished in the world and the Hereafter. Such are they who are the losers.",You O hypocrites are like those before you who were far mightier than you and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their share their lot in this world. So you enjoy O hypocrites your share just as those before you enjoyed their share and you indulge in vain talk in falsehood and defamation of the Prophet s just as they indulged in vain talk. Those their works have become invalid in this world and in the Hereafter; and those they indeed are the losers.
Repentance,9,70,"Hath not the fame of those before them reached them - the folk of Noah, A’ad, Thamud, the folk of Abraham, the dwellers of Midian and the disasters (which befell them) ? Their messengers (from Allah) came unto them with proofs (of Allah’s Sovereignty). So Allah surely wronged them not, but they did wrong themselves.",Has not the tidings the tale of those before them reached them — the folk of Noah and ‘Ād the folk of Hūd and Thamūd the folk of Sālih and the folk of Abraham and the dwellers of Midian the folk of Shu‘ayb and the Deviant cities? the cities of the folk of Lot meaning its inhabitants. Their messengers brought them clear proofs with miracles but they denied them and so were destroyed. God would never have wronged them by punishing them for no sin on their part but they wronged themselves by committing sin.
Repentance,9,71,"And the believers, men and women, are protecting friends one of another; they enjoin the right and forbid the wrong, and they establish worship and they pay the poor-due, and they obey Allah and His messenger. As for these, Allah will have mercy on them. Lo! Allah is Mighty, Wise.",And the believers both men and women are allies of one another; they enjoin decency and forbid indecency; they observe prayer and pay the alms and they obey God and His Messenger. Those God will have mercy on them. Truly God is Mighty nothing can prevent Him from fulfilling His promise and His threat; Wise He puts everything in its proper place.
Repentance,9,72,"Allah promiseth to the believers, men and women, Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide - blessed dwellings in Gardens of Eden. And - greater (far)! - acceptance from Allah. That is the supreme triumph.",God has promised the believers both men and women Gardens underneath which rivers flow to abide therein and blessed dwellings in the Gardens of Eden for residence and beatitude from God is greater is superior to all of that. That is the supreme triumph.
Repentance,9,73,"O Prophet! Strive against the disbelievers and the hypocrites! Be harsh with them. Their ultimate abode is hell, a hapless journey’s end.",O Prophet struggle against the disbelievers with the sword and the hypocrites with words and definitive arguments and be harsh with them through rebuke and aversion towards them; for their abode will be Hell an evil journey’s end an evil resort it is!
Repentance,9,74,"They swear by Allah that they said nothing (wrong), yet they did say the word of disbelief, and did disbelieve after their Surrender (to Allah). And they purposed that which they could not attain, and they sought revenge only that Allah by His messenger should enrich them of His bounty. If they repent it will be better for them; and if they turn away, Allah will afflict them with a painful doom in the world and the Hereafter, and they have no protecting friend nor helper in the earth.",They the hypocrites swear by God that they said nothing of the defamation that has reached you as being from them; but they did indeed say the word of disbelief and did disbelieve after their submission to God they did indeed manifest disbelief after having manifested submission to God. And they purposed that which they never attained in the way of assassinating the Prophet on the night of al-‘Aqaba upon his return from Tabūk — there were about ten to twenty of them and ‘Ammār b. Yāsir struck the faces of their riding camels when they came against him and were thus repulsed; and they were only spiteful they detested that God and His Messenger should have enriched them of His bounty by way of spoils when they had been in dire need the meaning is that this was all that they attained from him which is nothing to be spiteful about. So if they repent of hypocrisy and believe in you it will be better for them; but if they turn away from belief God will chastise them with a painful chastisement in this world by having them killed and in the Hereafter in the Fire and they have none on earth as protector to guard them from Him or helper to defend them.
Repentance,9,75,And of them is he who made a covenant with Allah (saying): If He give us of His bounty we will give alms and become of the righteous.,And some of them have made a covenant with God saying ‘If He gives us of His bounty we will give voluntary alms la-nassaddaqanna the original tā’ of natasaddaqanna has been assimilated with the sād and become of the righteous’ this was Tha‘laba b. Hātib who asked the Prophet s to supplicate on his behalf so that God would give him wealth of which he would give every needy person his due. He the Prophet thus supplicated for him and he became wealthy but stopped attending the Friday prayer and congregational prayers and refused to pay the alms-tax as God exalted be He says
Repentance,9,76,"Yet when He gave them of His bounty, they hoarded it and turned away, averse;",Yet when He gave them of His bounty they became niggardly with it and turned away from obedience to God in aversion.
Repentance,9,77,"So He hath made the consequence (to be) hypocrisy in their hearts until the day when they shall meet Him, because they broke their word to Allah that they promised Him, and because they lied.",So He made the consequence in their case hypocrisy fixed in their hearts until the day they meet Him that is God on the Day of Resurrection because they failed God in what they promised Him and because of that concerning which they lied he Tha‘laba then brought the payment of his alms to the Prophet s who said to him ‘God has forbidden me to accept it from you’; so he Tha‘laba began to throw earth on his head in remorse. He then approached Abū Bakr with it who did not accept it. He then went to ‘Umar b. al-Khattāb who also did not accept it. He went to ‘Uthmān b. ‘Affān but he did not accept it; he died during the latter’s reign.
Repentance,9,78,"Know they not that Allah knoweth both their secret and the thought that they confide, and that Allah is the Knower of Things Hidden ?",Did they the hypocrites not know that God knows their secret what they conceal within themselves and their confidential talks what they confide in each other and that God is the Knower of the hidden things? what is concealed from the eyes.
Repentance,9,79,"Those who point at such of the believers as give the alms willingly and such as can find naught to give but their endeavours, and deride them - Allah (Himself) derideth them. Theirs will be a painful doom.",When the verse concerning ‘voluntary alms’ Q. 975 was revealed a man came and gave a large amount as voluntary alms so the hypocrites said ‘He is merely showing off!’ Another man then came and gave a moderate measure of food and so they said ‘God has no need of this man’s charity!’ The following was then revealed Those who alladhīna is the subject find fault with defame the believers who offer alms voluntarily performing supererogation and such as find nothing to offer but their endeavours nothing but what they are capable of and offer it; and deride them and the predicate of the mentioned subject is the following — God Himself derides them He has requited them for their derision and theirs will be a painful chastisement.
Repentance,9,80,"Ask forgiveness for them (O Muhammad), or ask not forgiveness for them; though thou ask forgiveness for them seventy times Allah will not forgive them. That is because they disbelieved in Allah and His messenger, and Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.",Ask forgiveness for them O Muhammad (s) or do not ask forgiveness for them this leaves the choice of asking forgiveness or refraining up to him; the Prophet s said ‘I have been given the choice and I made it’ meaning the choice to ask forgiveness as reported by al-Bukhārī. If you ask forgiveness for them seventy times God will not forgive them it is said that the ‘seventy’ is intended to express by hyperbole a great frequency of asking forgiveness. In the Sahīh of al-Bukhārī there is a hadīth which states ‘If I was sure that were I to ask more than seventy times God would forgive them I would have done so’. It is also said however that the very number seventy is actually meant on account of this other hadīth of his ‘I shall ask more than seventy times’ whereupon it was made clear to him the Prophet that the matter regarding forgiveness had been concluded by the verse Q. 636 Alike it will be regarding them whether you ask forgiveness for them or you do not ask forgiveness for them God will not forgive them; that is because they disbelieved in God and His Messenger; and God does not guide the wicked folk.
Repentance,9,81,"Those who were left behind rejoiced at sitting still behind the messenger of Allah, and were averse to striving with their wealth and their lives in Allah’s way. And they said: Go not forth in the heat! Say: The fire of hell is more intense of heat, if they but understood.",Those who were left behind from the journey to Tabūk rejoiced at remaining behind the Messenger of God and were averse to striving with their wealth and their lives in the way of God. And they said that is they said to one another ‘Do not go forth do not set off to join the fight in the heat!’ Say ‘The fire of Hell is hotter than Tabūk and more worthy for them to guard against by not staying behind did they but understand’ this they would not have stayed behind.
Repentance,9,82,"Then let them laugh a little: they will weep much, as the reward of what they used to earn.",But let them laugh a little in this world and weep much in the Hereafter as a requital for what they used to earn the sentence is predicative of their state expressed in the form of an imperative.
Repentance,9,83,"If Allah bring thee back (from the campaign) unto a party of them and they ask of thee leave to go out (to fight), then say unto them: Ye shall never more go out with me nor fight with me against a foe. Ye were content with sitting still the first time. So sit still, with the useless.",So if God brings you back from Tabūk to a party of them of those hypocrites who stayed behind in Medina and they ask leave of you to go forth with you on some other campaign say to them ‘You shall never more go forth with me and you shall never fight with me against an enemy. You were content to stay behind the first time so stay behind with those who stay behind’ away from military campaigns such as women and children and others.
Repentance,9,84,"And never (O Muhammad) pray for one of them who dieth, nor stand by his grave. Lo! they disbelieved in Allah and His messenger, and they died while they were evil-doers.",When the Prophet s prayed over the dead body of ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Ubayy the following was revealed And never pray over any one of them when he is dead nor stand over his grave at a burial or as a visit; lo! they disbelieved in God and His Messenger and died while they were wicked they died disbelieving.
Repentance,9,85,"Let not their wealth nor their children please thee! Allah purposeth only to punish them thereby in the world, and that their souls shall pass away while they are disbelievers.",And let not their wealth and their children please you; God desires only to chastise them thereby in this world and that their souls should depart while they are disbelievers.
Repentance,9,86,"And when a surah is revealed (which saith): Believe in Allah and strive along with His messenger, the men of wealth among them still ask leave of thee and say: Suffer us to be with those who sit (at home).",And when a sūra that is a section of the Qur’ān is revealed saying ‘Believe in God and strive with His Messenger’ the affluent among them ask leave of you saying ‘Leave us to be with those who sit at home’.
Repentance,9,87,"They are content that they should be with the useless and their hearts are sealed, so that they apprehend not.",They are content to be with those who stay behind khawālif is the plural of khālifa meaning the women who ‘stay behind’ takhallafna at home and a seal has been set upon their hearts so they do not understand what is good.
Repentance,9,88,But the messenger and those who believe with him strive with their wealth and their lives. Such are they for whom are the good things. Such are they who are the success,But the Messenger and those who believe with him strive with their wealth and their lives for them are the good things in this life and in the Hereafter; those they are the successful the triumphant.
Repentance,9,89,"Allah hath made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide. That is the supreme triumph.",God has prepared for them Gardens underneath which rivers flow to abide therein that is the supreme triumph.
Repentance,9,90,And those among the wandering Arabs who had an excuse came in order that permission might be granted them. And those who lied to Allah and His messenger sat at home. A painful doom will fall on those of them who disbelieve.,And those Bedouins who had an excuse al-mu‘adhdhirūn the original tā’ has been assimilated with the dāl in other words it would usually be read as al-mu‘tadhirūn which itself is a variant reading those of them who were excused came to the Prophet s asking for leave to stay behind on account of their excuses and so he gave them leave to do so. And those who lied to God and His Messenger by feigning belief those hypocrites among the Bedouin stayed behind refraining from coming to give their excuses — a painful chastisement shall befall those of them who disbelieve.
Repentance,9,91,"Not unto the weak nor unto the sick nor unto those who can find naught to spend is any fault (to be imputed though they stay at home) if they are true to Allah and His messenger. Not unto the good is there any road (of blame). Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.",As for the weak such as the old and the sick the blind and the chronically ill and those who find nothing to expend for the struggle no blame no sin falls upon them should they stay away from it if they remain true to God and to His Messenger when they stay behind by not spreading false rumours or impeding others from joining the struggle but by adhering to obedience. There is no way of blame no way of reproach against those who are virtuous through such behaviour. And God is Forgiving Merciful to them by granting them such leeway in this matter.
Repentance,9,92,"Nor unto those whom, when they came to thee (asking) that thou shouldst mount them, thou didst tell: I cannot find whereon to mount you. They turned back with eyes flowing with tears, for sorrow that they could not find the means to spend.",Nor against those who when they came to you so that you might give them a mount to ride with you on the raid — these were seven men of the Ansār; but it is also said that they were the Banū Muqrin — you having said to them ‘I cannot find a mount whereon to mount you’ this last sentence is a circumstantial qualifier turned back this is the response to the clause beginning with idhā ‘when’ that is they departed their eyes flowing pouring with tears min al-dam‘i min is explicative for sorrow that they could not find the means to expend for the campaign struggle.
Repentance,9,93,The road (of blame) is only against those who ask for leave of thee (to stay at home) when they are rich. They are content to be with the useless. Allah hath sealed their hearts so that they know not.,The way of blame is only against those who ask leave of you to stay behind when they are rich. They are content to be with those who stay behind and God has set a seal on their hearts so that they do not know a similar statement has already been made.
Repentance,9,94,"They will make excuse to you (Muslims) when ye return unto them. Say: Make no excuse, for we shall not believe you. Allah hath told us tidings of you. Allah and His messenger will see your conduct, and then ye will be brought back unto Him Who knoweth the Invisible as well as the Visible, and He will tell you what ye used to do.",They will make excuses to you for having stayed behind when you return to them from the campaign. Say to them ‘Do not make excuses; we will never believe you! God has already told us tidings of you that is He has already informed us of your true status. And God will see your work and so will His Messenger then you will be returned through resurrection to the Knower of the unseen and the visible meaning to God and He will tell you what you used to do’ and requite you for it.
Repentance,9,95,"They will swear by Allah unto you, when ye return unto them, that ye may let them be. Let them be, for lo! they are unclean, and their abode is hell as the reward for what they used to earn.",They will swear to you by God when you turn back when you return to them from Tabūk that they had genuine excuses for staying behind so that you may leave them be refraining from reproaching them. So leave them be for they are an abomination filth on account of their inner vileness and their abode shall be Hell as requital for what they used to earn.
Repentance,9,96,"They swear unto you, that ye may accept them. Though ye accept them. Allah verily accepteth not wrongdoing folk.",They will swear to you that you may be satisfied with them; but if you are satisfied with them God will surely not be satisfied with the wicked folk that is with them your satisfaction is of no avail in the face of the wrath of God.

And Allah is Knower, Wise.",The Bedouins the Arab nomads are more intense in unbelief and hypocrisy than the city-dwellers on account of their harshness and crude nature and their being too remote to hear the Qur’ān and are more likely not to know the bounds of what God has revealed to His Messenger in the way of rulings and legal prescriptions; and God is Knower of His creatures Wise in what He does with them.
Repentance,9,98,"And of the wandering Arabs there is he who taketh that which he expendeth (for the cause of Allah) as a loss, and awaiteth (evil) turns of fortune for you (that he may be rid of it). The evil turn of fortune will be theirs. Allah is Hearer, Knower.",And of the Bedouins there is he who takes what he expends in the way of God as a penalty as a liability and a financial loss because he does not aspire to be rewarded for it but expends it out of fear these were Banū Asad and Banū Ghatafān; and awaits for you evil turns of fortune the fortunes of time for you that these should turn against you and so be rid of you. Theirs shall be the evil read as al-sū‘ or al-saw‘ turn of fortune that is chastisement and destruction shall turn on them not on you. And God is Hearer of the sayings of His servants Knower of their actions.
Repentance,9,99,"And of the wandering Arabs there is he who believeth in Allah and the Last Day, and taketh that which he expendeth and also the prayers of the messenger as acceptable offerings in the sight of Allah. Lo! verily it is an acceptable offering for them. Allah will bring them into His mercy. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.",And of the Bedouins there is he who believes in God and the Last Day such as men from among the tribes of Juhayna and Muzayna and takes what he expends in the way of God as pious offerings to bring him nearer to God and as a means to secure the prayers the supplications of the Messenger for him. Surely these the expenditure of such men will bring them nearer read qurubatun or qurbatun to Him. God will admit them into His mercy His Paradise. Truly God is Forgiving to those who obey Him Merciful to them.
Repentance,9,100,"And the first to lead the way, of the Muhajirin and the Ansar, and those who followed them in goodness - Allah is well pleased with them and they are well pleased with Him, and He hath made ready for them Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide for ever. That is the supreme triumph.",And the first to lead the way of the Emigrants and the Helpers namely those who were present at the battle of Badr or it means all the Companions and those who follow them up to the Day of Resurrection by being virtuous in deeds God will be pleased with them for their obedience of Him and they will be pleased with Him for His reward to them; and He has prepared for them Gardens — with rivers flowing beneath them a variant reading adds min min tahtihā ‘beneath which’ — to abide therein forever that is the supreme triumph.
Repentance,9,101,"And among those around you of the wandering Arabs there are hypocrites, and among the townspeople of Al-Madinah (there are some who) persist in hypocrisy whom thou (O Muhammad) knowest not. We, We know them, and We shall chastise them twice; then they will be relegated to a painful doom.",And among those around you O inhabitants of Medina of the Bedouins there are hypocrites such as the tribes of Aslam Ashja‘ and Ghifār and among the townspeople of Medina there are also hypocrites who are obstinate in hypocrisy engrossed in it and persisting in it. You do not know them — an address to the Prophet s — but We know them and We shall chastise them twice by disgracing them or having them killed in this world and by way of punishment in the grave then they will be returned in the Hereafter to a terrible chastisement namely the Fire.
Repentance,9,102,"And (there are) others who have acknowledged their faults. They mixed a righteous action with another that was bad. It may be that Allah will relent toward them. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.",And there are others ākharūn is the subject another folk who have confessed their sins for having stayed behind i‘tarafū bi-dhunūbihim is an adjectival qualification of it the subject and the predicate is the following khalatū ‘amalan sālihan they have mixed a righteous deed that is their former participation in the struggle or the their confession of their sins or otherwise with another that was bad which is their having stayed behind. It may be that God will relent to them. Truly God is Forgiving Merciful this was revealed regarding Abū Lubāba and a group of men who tied themselves to the walls of the mosque after they heard what had been revealed regarding those who stayed behind; they swore that only the Prophet s would untie them which he did when this verse was revealed.
Repentance,9,103,"Take alms of their wealth, wherewith thou mayst purify them and mayst make them grow, and pray for them. Lo! thy prayer is an assuagement for them. Allah is Hearer, Knower.",Take of their wealth some alms to purify them and to cleanse them thereby of their sins; he thus took a third of their wealth and gave it away as charity; and pray for them that is supplicate for them; truly your prayers are a comfort a mercy for them it is also said to mean reassurance for them that their repentance has been accepted. And God is Hearer Knower.
Repentance,9,104,"Know they not that Allah is He Who accepteth repentance from His bondmen and taketh the alms, and that Allah is He Who is the Relenting, the Merciful.",Do they not know that God is He Who accepts repentance from His servants and takes accepts the voluntary alms and that God is He Who is the Relenting to His servants by accepting their repentance and the Merciful? to them the interrogative is intended as an affirmative statement and is meant to incite them to offer repentance and charity.
Repentance,9,105,"And say (unto them): Act! Allah will behold your actions, and (so will) His messenger and the believers, and ye will be brought back to the Knower of the Invisible and the Visible, and He will tell you what ye used to do.",And say to them or to people in general ‘Act as you will for God will surely see your actions and so will His Messenger and the believers and you will be returned through resurrection to the Knower of the unseen and the visible that is to God and He will tell you what you used to do’ and so requite you for it.
Repentance,9,106,"And (there are) others who await Allah’s decree, whether He will punish them or will forgive them. Allah is Knower, Wise.",And there are others from among those who stayed behind who are deferred read murja’ūna or murjawna whose repentance is delayed to God’s command concerning them according to His will whether He chastises them by causing them to die without their having made any repentance or relents to them; and God is Knower of His creatures Wise in what He does with them. These others mentioned are the three who will be mentioned afterwards Murāra b. al-Rabī‘ Ka‘b b. Mālik and Hilāl b. Umayya. They stayed behind out of laziness and their inclination for peace and quiet not out of hypocrisy. Unlike the others however they did not excuse themselves before the Prophet s and so the matter regarding them was suspended for fifty days during which time people avoided them until it was later revealed that God had relented to them.
Repentance,9,107,"And as for those who chose a place of worship out of opposition and disbelief, and in order to cause dissent among the believers, and as an outpost for those who warred against Allah and His messenger aforetime, they will surely swear: We purposed naught save good. Allah beareth witness that they verily are liars.",And among them those who have chosen a mosque — these were twelve men from among the hypocrites — by way of harm to cause distress for those of the mosque of Qubā’ and disbelief since they built it on the orders of the monk Abū ‘Āmir as a sanctuary for him so that whoever comes from his side may stay there he had gone to the Byzantine Emperor qaysar to bring troops to fight against the Prophet s and to cause division among the believers who pray in the mosque of Qubā’ by having some of these pray in their the hypocrites’ mosque and as an outpost an observation post for those who waged war against God and His Messenger before that is before it was built — meaning the above-mentioned Abū ‘Āmir — they will swear ‘We desired nothing by building it but to do good’ by way of kindness towards the poor in times of heavy rain or extreme heat and in order to provide a place of worship for the Muslims; and God bears witness that they are truly liars in this claim of theirs. They had asked the Prophet s to perform prayers in it and so the following was revealed
Repentance,9,108,"Never stand (to pray) there. A place of worship which was found upon duty (to Allah) from the first day is more worthy that thou shouldst stand (to pray) therein, wherein are men who love to purify themselves. Allah loveth the purifiers.",Never stand never perform prayer there and so he sent a group of men to destroy and burn it and in its place they left a refuse pit where decaying cadavers would be dumped. A mosque which was founded one whose foundations were built upon piety from the first day constructed the day you arrived in Medina dār al-hijra — this was the mosque of Qubā’ as mentioned in Bukhārī — is worthier than that other one for you to stand to perform prayer therein; in it are men namely the Ansār who love to purify themselves; and God loves those who purify themselves muttahhirīn the original tā’ of mutatahhirūn has been assimilated with the tā’ that is He will reward them. Ibn Khuzayma reported in his Sahīh by way of an isnād from ‘Uwaym b. Sā‘ida that ‘The Prophet s came to them at the mosque of Qubā’ and said “God exalted be He has praised handsomely the way you purify yourselves in the story about your mosque so what is this purification which you perform?” They said “By God O Messenger of God all that we know is that we used to have Jews in our vicinity and they used to wash their behinds after defecation and so we began to wash in the way they did”’. According to one hadīth reported by al-Bazzār they said ‘We use stones to scrape off remnants and follow this with water’; to which he the Prophet said ‘That is the way for proper purification. Let this be your way’.
Repentance,9,109,"Is he who founded his building upon duty to Allah and His good pleasure better; or he who founded his building on the brink of a crumbling, overhanging precipice so that it toppled with him into the fire of hell ? Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.",Is he who founded his building upon fear of God and in hope of beatitude from Him better or he who founded his building upon the brink the edge of a bank an overhang that is crumbling about to collapse read juruf or jurf so that it toppled with him so that it collapsed taking with it the one who built it into the fire of Hell? this is an excellent similitude for building upon that which constitutes the opposite of fear of God and for what it leads to; the interrogative is meant as an affirmative in other words the former is the better which is the likeness of the building of the mosque of Qubā’ while the latter is the likeness of the mosque of ‘harm’ masjid al-dirār. And God guides not the evildoing folk.
Repentance,9,110,"The building which they built will never cease to be a misgiving in their hearts unless their hearts be torn to pieces. Allah is Knower, Wise.",The buildings which they have built will never cease to be a misgiving a point of doubt in their hearts unless their hearts are cut torn to pieces such that they die; and God is Knower of His creatures Wise in what He does with them.
Repentance,9,111,"Lo! Allah hath bought from the believers their lives and their wealth because the Garden will be theirs: they shall fight in the way of Allah and shall slay and be slain. It is a promise which is binding on Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur’an. Who fulfilleth His covenant better than Allah ? Rejoice then in your bargain that ye have made, for that is the supreme triumph.",Indeed God has purchased from the believers their lives and their possessions that they expend it in obedience of Him — for example by striving in His way — so that theirs will be the reward of Paradise they shall fight in the way of God and they shall kill and be killed this sentence is independent and constitutes an explication of the above-mentioned ‘purchase’; a variant reading has the passive verb come first sc. fa-yuqtalūna wa-yaqtulūn ‘they shall be killed and shall kill’ meaning that some of them are killed while those who remain fight on; that is a promise which is binding both wa‘dan ‘promise’ and haqqan ‘binding’ are verbal nouns and are in the accusative on account of their omitted implicit verbs upon Him in the Torah and the Gospel and the Qur’ān; and who fulfils his covenant better than God? that is no one is better in fulfilling it. Rejoice then there is a shift from the third to second person here in this bargain of yours which you have made for that bargain is the supreme triumph the one that secures the ultimate goal.
Repentance,9,112,"(Triumphant) are those who turn repentant (to Allah), those who serve (Him), those who praise (Him), those who fast, those who bow down, those who fall prostrate (in worship), those who enjoin the right and who forbid the wrong and those who keep the limits (ordained) of Allah - And give glad tidings to believers!",Those who repent al-tā’ibūna is in the nominative as a laudative the subject being implicit from idolatry and hypocrisy those who worship who devote their worship sincerely to God those who give praise to Him in every state those who fast those who bow those who prostrate themselves that is those who perform prayers those who enjoin decency and forbid to indecency those who maintain God’s bounds His rulings by implementing them and give good tidings to the believers of Paradise.
Repentance,9,113,"It is not for the Prophet, and those who believe, to pray for the forgiveness of idolaters even though they may be near of kin (to them) after it hath become clear that they are people of hell-fire.",The following was revealed regarding the Prophet s asking forgiveness for his uncle Abū Tālib and some of the Companions asking forgiveness for their idolatrous parents It is not for the Prophet and those who believe to ask forgiveness for the idolaters even though they be kinsmen relatives after it has become clear to them that they are inhabitants of the Hell-fire for having died as disbelievers.
Repentance,9,114,"The prayer of Abraham for the forgiveness of his father was only because of a promise he had promised him, but when it had become clear unto him that he (his father) was an enemy to Allah he (Abraham) disowned him. Lo! Abraham was soft of heart, long-suffering.",Abraham’s prayer for the forgiveness of his father was only because of a promise he had made to him when he said to him I will ask my Lord forgiveness for you Q. 1947 in the hope that he would submit to God; but when it became clear to him that he was an enemy of God upon his death as an disbeliever he declared himself innocent of him and refrained from asking forgiveness for him; truly Abraham was soft of heart making frequent entreaty and supplication to God forbearing enduring harm patiently.
Repentance,9,115,It was never Allah’s (part) that He should send a folk astray after He had guided them until He had made clear unto them what they should avoid. Lo! Allah is Aware of all things.,And God would never send a people astray after He had guided them to Islam until He had made clear to them that which they should be wary of in the way of deeds but when they are not wary of it then they deserve to be sent astray. Surely God is Knower of all things including who deserves to be sent astray or to be guided.
Repentance,9,116,"Lo! Allah! Unto Him belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth. He quickeneth and He giveth death. And ye have, instead of Allah, no protecting friend nor helper.",Surely to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and of the earth. He gives life and He makes to die; and you do not have O mankind besides God that is other than Him any protector to preserve you from Him or helper to defend you against His hurt.
Repentance,9,117,"Allah hath turned in mercy to the Prophet, and to the Muhajirin and the Ansar who followed him in the hour of hardship. After the hearts of a party of them had almost swerved aside, then turned He unto them in mercy. Lo! He is Full of Pity, Merciful for them.",God has truly relented that is He has truly perpetuated His relenting to the Prophet and the Emigrants and the Helpers who followed him in the hour of hardship that is during the time of this hardship which was their predicament during the raid at Tabūk where two men would share a single date ten men would take turns on one camel and where the heat became so intense that they resorted to drinking filth; after the hearts of a party of them had almost deviated read either as tazīghu or yazīghu had almost inclined away from following him in favour of staying behind due to the hardship that afflicted them then He relented to them by making them steadfast. Truly He is Gentle Merciful to them.
Repentance,9,118,"And to the three also (did He turn in mercy) who were left behind, when the earth, vast as it is, was straitened for them, and their own souls were straitened for them till they bethought them that there is no refuge from Allah save toward Him. Then turned He unto them in mercy that they (too) might turn (repentant unto Him). Lo! Allah! He is the Relenting, the Merciful.",And He relented to the three who were left behind formerly denied His relenting to them for the same reason as those mentioned above when the earth was straitened for them for all its breadth that is despite its vastness so they could find no place wherein to feel secure and their souls that is their hearts were straitened for them because of the anxiety and their sense of alienation resulting from the delay of God’s relenting to them with mercy such that they their souls could not find happiness or solace; until they thought they were certain that read the softened an there is no refuge from God except in Him. Then He turned relenting to them He made them successful in finding repentance that they might also turn in repentance. Truly God is the Relenting the Merciful.
Repentance,9,119,"O ye who believe! Be careful of your duty to Allah, and be with the truthful.",O you who believe fear God by refraining from acts of disobedience to Him and be with those who are truthful in their faith and covenants by adhering to sincerity.
Repentance,9,120,"It is not for the townsfolk of Al-Madinah and for those around them of the wandering Arabs so stay behind the messenger of Allah and prefer their lives to his life. That is because neither thirst nor toil nor hunger afflicteth them in the way of Allah, nor step they any step that angereth the disbelievers, nor gain they from the enemy a gain, but a good deed is recorded for them therefor. Lo! Allah loseth not the wages of the good.",It is not for the people of Medina and for the Bedouins who dwell around them to stay behind God’s Messenger when he sets out on a campaign and to prefer their lives to his life by guarding them against hardships which he the Prophet is content to suffer himself this statement is a prohibition expressed as a predicate; that prohibition against staying behind is because neither thirst nor toil nor hunger afflicts them in the way of God nor tread they any tread mawti’an is a verbal noun meaning wat’an that enrages the disbelievers nor gain any gain from the enemy of God be it through slaughter capture or plunder but a righteous deed is therefore recorded for them that they may be rewarded for it. Truly God does not leave the wage of the virtuous to go to waste that is the wage of those mentioned rather He rewards them.
Repentance,9,121,"Nor spend they any spending, small or great, nor do they cross a valley, but it is recorded for them, that Allah may repay them the best of what they used to do.",Nor expend they therein in the way of God any sum small even if it be a single date or great nor do they cross a valley during a campaign march but it is recorded for them as a righteous deed that God may reward them the best of what they used to do that is the due reward thereof.
Repentance,9,122,"And the believers should not all go out to fight. Of every troop of them, a party only should go forth, that they (who are left behind) may gain sound knowledge in religion, and that they may warn their folk when they return to them, so that they may beware.",When the Prophet s was about to dispatch a raiding party — after they certain Muslims had been reproached for staying behind — all of them went forth and so the following was revealed It is not for the believers to go forth on a raid altogether why should not a party a group of every section of every tribe of them go forth while the others remain behind so that they those who remain behind may become learned in religion and that they may warn their folk when they return to them from the raid by teaching them some of the rulings which they have come to learn so that they may beware? of God’s punishment by adhering to His commands and prohibitions. Ibn ‘Abbās said that this verse is specifically intended for raiding parties while the previous one is specifically to prohibit any individual staying behind when the Prophet s sets out on a campaign.
Repentance,9,123,"O ye who believe! Fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you, and let them find harshness in you, and know that Allah is with those who keep their duty (unto Him).",O you who believe fight those of the disbelievers who are near to you that is the nearest followed by the next nearest of them and let them find harshness in you that is severity in other words be harsh with them and know that God is with the pious helping and granting them victory.
Repentance,9,124,"And whenever a surah is revealed there are some of them who say: Which one of you hath thus increased in faith ? As for those who believe, it hath increased them in faith and they rejoice (therefor).",And whenever a sūra of the Qur’ān is revealed there are some of them that is the hypocrites who say to their companions mockingly ‘Which of you has this increased in faith?’ and God says As for those who believe it has increased them in faith because they accept that it is true and they rejoice because of it.
Repentance,9,125,"But as for those in whose hearts is disease, it only addeth wickedness to their wickedness, and they die while they are disbelievers.",But as for those in whose hearts is sickness a weakness of faith it only adds abomination to their abomination that is it only adds disbelief to their disbelief since they disbelieve in it and they die while they were disbelievers.
Repentance,9,126,"See they not that they are tested once or twice in every year ? Still they turn not in repentance, neither pay they heed.",Do they not see that is the hypocrites in which case read a-wa-lā yarawna; or if read a-wa-lā tarawna ‘do you O believers not see’ that they are tested afflicted every year once or twice? with drought and diseases. Still they do not repent of their hypocrisy nor do they remember nor do they heed admonition.
Repentance,9,127,"And whenever a surah is revealed, they look one at another (as who should say): Doth anybody see you ? Then they turn away. Allah turneth away their hearts because they are a folk who understand not.",And whenever a sūra is revealed wherein is mention of them and the Prophet s recites it they look at one another desiring to flee and saying ‘Will anyone see you?’ if you get up and flee? and so if no one can see them they get up and leave otherwise they stay put. Then they turn away persisting in their disbelief. God turns their hearts away from guidance because they are a folk who do not understand the truth for they do not reflect on it.
Repentance,9,128,"There hath come unto you a messenger, (one) of yourselves, unto whom aught that ye are overburdened is grievous, full of concern for you, for the believers full of pity, merciful.",Verily there has come to you a messenger from among yourselves that is one of you — Muhammad (s) — for whom it is grievous hard that you should suffer that is your suffering your experiencing hardship and encountering harm is hard on him; who is full of concern for you that you should be rightly guided; to the believers full of pity profoundly compassionate merciful desiring good for them.
Repentance,9,129,"Now, if they turn away (O Muhammad) say: Allah sufficeth me. There is no God save Him. In Him have I put my trust, and He is Lord of the Tremendous Throne.",So if they turn away refraining from believing in you say ‘God suffices me. There is no god except Him. Upon Him I rely in Him have I put my trust and in none other and He is the Lord of the Tremendous Throne’ al-‘arsh al-azīm the kursī which is singled out for mention because it is the greatest of all things created. Al-Hākim reported in al-Mustadrak by way of an isnād from Ubayy b. Ka‘b that he Ubayy said ‘The last verse to be revealed was from Verily there has come to you a messenger… to the end of the sūra’ sc. Q. 9128-129.
Jonah,10,1,Alif. Lam. Ra. These are verses of the Wise Scripture.,Alif lām rā’ God knows best what He means by these letters. Those namely these signs are the signs of the wise Book that is the Qur’ān the genitive annexation āyāt al-kitāb has the meaning of min sc. min āyāti’l-kitāb ‘from among the verses of the Book’ which has been made clear.
Jonah,10,2,"Is it a wonder for mankind that We have inspired a man among them, saying: Warn mankind and bring unto those who believe the good tidings that they have a sure footing with their Lord ? The disbelievers say: Lo! this is a mere wizard.",Is it for the people the people of Mecca this interrogative is meant as a disavowal; the preposition li- ‘for’ and its dependent genitive noun al-nās ‘the people’ constitute a circumstantial qualifier of His saying a wonder ‘ajaban read in the accusative as a predicate of kāna; or if read in the nominative ‘ajabun as its subject its predicate which is also its subject if read according to the former accusative reading is the following an awhaynā that We have inspired a man from among them Muhammad (s) saying an ‘that’ is explicative ‘Warn threaten the people the disbelievers with chastisement and give good tidings to those who believe that they have a prior a preceding promise of truth with their Lord’? that is a preceding fair reward in return for the deeds they have sent forward. The disbelievers say ‘Truly this Qur’ān that comprises all of that mentioned is manifest sorcery’ a variant reading for la-sihrun has la-sāhirun ‘a sorcerer’ where it is the Prophet s to whom they are referring as being ‘a manifest sorcerer’.
Jonah,10,3,"Lo! your Lord is Allah Who created the heavens and the earth in six Days, then He established Himself upon the Throne, directing all things. There is no intercessor (with Him) save after His permission. That is Allah, your Lord, so worship Him. Oh, will ye not remind ?",Truly your Lord is God Who created the heavens and the earth in six days of the days of this world that is in the same measure of time since there was no sun or moon then had He willed He could have created them in an instant but the reason for His not having done so is that He wanted to teach His creatures to be circumspect; then He presided upon the Throne a presiding befitting of Him directing affairs among creatures. There is no mā min indicates a relative clause intercessor to intercede for anyone save after His permission a refutation of their saying ‘The idols intercede for us!’; that Creator and Director is God your Lord so worship Him affirm His Oneness. Will you not remember? tadhakkarūna the original tā’ of tatadhakkarūna has been assimilated with the dhāl.
Jonah,10,4,"Unto Him is the return of all of you; it is a promise of Allah in truth. Lo! He produceth creation, then reproduceth it, that He may reward those who believe and do good works with equity; while, as for those who disbelieve, theirs will be a boiling drink and painful doom because they disbelieved.",To Him exalted be He is the return of all of you God’s promise in truth both wa‘da and haqqan are verbal nouns and in the accusative because of the verbs implicit in them. Truly He read innahu as a new sentence or annahu with an implied lām sc. li-annahu ‘Because He’ originates creation that is He began it by originating it then recreates it through resurrection that He may requite reward those who believe and perform righteous deeds justly. And those who disbelieve for them will be a draught of boiling water and a painful chastisement because they disbelieved.
Jonah,10,5,"He it is Who appointed the sun a splendour and the moon a light, and measured for her stages, that ye might know the number of the years, and the reckoning. Allah created not (all) that save in truth. He detaileth the revelations for people who have knowledge.",He it is Who made the sun a radiance that is emitting light and the moon a light and determined it with respect to its movement in stations 28 stations in 28 nights every month becoming concealed for two nights when a particular month has 30 days or concealed for one night when it has 29 days so that you might know thereby the number of the years and the reckoning. God did not create that which is mentioned save in truth not in vain exalted be He above such things. He details read yufassilu or nufassilu ‘We detail’ the signs for a people who know who reflect.
Jonah,10,6,"Lo! in the difference of day and night and all that Allah hath created in the heavens and the earth are portents, verily, for folk who ward off (evil).",Truly in the alternation of night and day in their coming and going increasing and diminishing and in what God has created in the heavens of angels sun moon stars and other things and in the earth of animals mountains seas rivers trees and other things there are signs indications of His power exalted be He for a people who fear Him and so believe He singles these out for mention because they are the ones to benefit from them such signs.
Jonah,10,7,"Lo! those who expect not the meeting with Us but desire the life of the world and feel secure therein, and those who are neglectful of Our revelations,",Truly those who do not expect to encounter Us through resurrection and are content with the life of this world instead of the life the Hereafter since they reject the truth of it and feel reassured feel secure in it and those who are heedless of Our signs of the proofs of Our Oneness neglecting to ponder them
Jonah,10,8,Their home will be the Fire because of what they used to earn.,those their abode will be the Fire because of what they used to earn in the way of practising idolatry and performing acts of disobedience.
Jonah,10,9,"Lo! those who believe and do good works, their Lord guideth them by their faith. Rivers will flow beneath them in the Gardens of Delight,",Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds their Lord will guide them He will lead them through their faith in Him by appointing for them a light with which they will be able to find their way on the Day of Resurrection. Rivers will flow beneath them in the Gardens of Bliss
Jonah,10,10,"Their prayer therein will be: Glory be to Thee, O Allah! and their greeting therein will be: Peace. And the conclusion of their prayer will be: Praise be to Allah, Lord of the Worlds!",their prayer therein their request for what they desire in Paradise will be to say ‘Glory be to You O God!’ so that lo! what they request they find before them; and their greeting between them therein will be ‘Peace.’ And their final prayer will be ‘Praise be to God Lord of the Worlds’.
Jonah,10,11,"If Allah were to hasten on for men the ill (that they have earned) as they would hasten on the good, their respite would already have expired. But We suffer those who look not for the meeting with Us to wander blindly on in their contumacy.",When the idolaters sought to hasten their chastisement the following was revealed And if God should hasten for mankind evil as they would hasten good their term of life would already have been concluded for them read as the passive with nominative ajaluhum sc. la-qudiya ajaluhum; or read as the active with accusative ajalahum sc. la-qadā ajalahum ‘He would have already concluded their term’ by His destroying them but He gives them respite. But We leave those who do not expect to encounter Us to wander blindly in their insolence hesistant and perplexed.
Jonah,10,12,"And if misfortune touch a man he crieth unto Us, (while reclining) on his side, or sitting or standing, but when We have relieved him of the misfortune he goeth his way as though he had not cried unto Us because of a misfortune that afflicted him. Thus is what they do made (seeming) fair unto the prodigal.",If misfortune illness or poverty should befall a disbelieving man he calls upon Us on his side that is lying down or sitting or standing in other words in every state; but when We have relieved him of his misfortune he passes on in his unbelief as if ka-an is softened its subject omitted in other words read as ka-annahu he had never called upon Us because of a misfortune that befell him. So in the same way that supplication during misfortune and abstention from supplication in times of comfort were adorned for him is adorned for the prodigal the idolaters that which they do.
Jonah,10,13,We destroyed the generations before you when they did wrong; and their messengers (from Allah) came unto them with clear proofs (of His Sovereignty) but they would not believe. Thus do We reward the guilty folk.,And indeed We have destroyed generations communities before you O people of Mecca when they did evil by way of idolatry and indeed their messengers brought them clear proofs indicating their truthfulness; but they would not believe wa-mā kānū li-yu’minū this is a supplement to zalamū ‘they did evil’. So just as We destroyed those We shall requite the sinning the unbelieving folk.
Jonah,10,14,"Then We appointed you viceroys in the earth after them, that We might see how ye behave.",Then We made you O people of Mecca successors khalā’if is the plural of khalīfa in the earth after them that We might behold how you would behave in it and whether you would take heed from their example and believe in Our messengers.
Jonah,10,15,"And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them, they who look not for the meeting with Us say: Bring a Lecture other than this, or change it. Say (O Muhammad): It is not for me to change it of my accord. I only follow that which is inspired in me. Lo! if I disobey my Lord I fear the retribution of an awful Day.",And when Our clear manifest bayyināt is a circumstantial qualifier verses from the Qur’ān are recited to them those who do not expect to encounter Us those who do not fear the Resurrection say ‘Bring a Qur’ān other than this one in which our gods are not denigrated or change it’ of your own accord. Say to them ‘It is not for me to change it of my own accord. I only follow that which is revealed to me. Truly I fear if I should disobey my Lord by changing it the chastisement of a dreadful day’ that is the Day of Resurrection.
Jonah,10,16,Say: If Allah had so willed I should not have recited it to you nor would He have made it known to you. I dwelt among you a whole lifetime before it (came to me). Have ye then no sense ?,Say ‘If God had willed I would not have recited it to you nor would He have made it known to you nor would He have made you aware of it the lā of wa-lā adrākum is for negation and is a supplement to what preceded; a variant reading has the lām sc. la-adrākum ‘He would have made it known to you’ as the response to the conditional law ‘if’ in other words He would have made it known to you by the tongue of someone other than myself. For I have already dwelt among you a whole lifetime of forty years before this Qur’ān not relating to you anything of the sort so will you not understand?’ that this Qur’ān is not from myself?
Jonah,10,17,Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah and denieth His revelations ? Lo! the guilty never are successful.,And who that is no one does greater evil than he who invents a lie against God by ascribing a partner to Him or denies His signs? denies the Qur’ān. Surely it is that the sinners the idolaters shall not prosper they shall never find happiness.
Jonah,10,18,"They worship beside Allah that which neither hurteth them nor profiteth them, and they say: These are our intercessors with Allah. Say: Would ye inform Allah of (something) that He knoweth not in the heavens or in the earth ? Praised be He and High Exalted above all that ye associate (with Him)!",And they worship besides God that is other than Him that which can neither hurt them should they not worship it nor profit them if they do worship it — and these are the idols; and they say of them ‘These are our intercessors with God’. Say to them ‘Would you tell would you inform God of what He does not know in the heavens or in the earth?’ the interrogative is meant as a disavowal for if He had a partner He Himself would know it since nothing can be hidden from Him. Glory be to Him! in affirmation of His transcendence and High be He exalted above what they associate! with Him.
Jonah,10,19,Mankind were but one community; then they differed; and had it not been for a word that had already gone forth from thy Lord it had been judged between them in respect of that wherein they differ.,Mankind was but one community following one religion that is submission to the One God from the time of Adam to the time of Noah; but it is also said that this was the case from the time of Abraham to that of ‘Amr b. Luhayy; then they differed some of them remaining firmly upon belief in One God while others disbelieved. And had it not been for a word that had already preceded from your Lord to the effect that requital would be deferred until the Day of Resurrection it would have been decided between them that is between mankind in this life regarding that over which they differed in religion by the disbelievers being punished.
Jonah,10,20,"And they will say: If only a portent were sent down upon him from his Lord! Then say, (O Muhammad): The Unseen belongeth to Allah. So wait! Lo! I am waiting with you.",And they the people of Mecca say ‘Why has a sign not been sent down on him on Muhammad (s) from his Lord?’ as was the case with previous prophets in the way of a she-camel a staff or a glowing hand. Then say to them ‘The Unseen that which is concealed from servants in other words its affair belongs only to God and it is from this Unseen that signs come forth; therefore He alone can bring them forth mine is only to covey the Message. So wait for the chastisement if you do not believe. I am waiting with you’.
Jonah,10,21,"And when We cause mankind to taste of mercy after some adversity which had afflicted them, behold! they have some plot against Our revelations. Say: Allah is more swift in plotting. Lo! Our messengers write down that which ye plot.",And when We made people that is the disbelievers of Mecca taste of mercy of rain and fertility after adversity misery and drought that had afflicted them behold! they have some plot concerning Our signs in the way of mockery and denial. Say to them ‘God is swifter at plotting at requiting; surely Our guardian messengers are writing down that which you are plotting’ tamkurūn is also read yamkurūn ‘they are plotting’.
Jonah,10,22,"He it is Who maketh you to go on the land and the sea till, when ye are in the ships and they sail with them with a fair breeze and they are glad therein, a storm-wind reacheth them and the wave cometh unto them from every side and they deem that they are overwhelmed therein; (then) they cry unto Allah, making their faith pure for Him only: If Thou deliver us from this, we truly will be of the thankful.",He it is Who conveys you yusayyirukum a variant reading has yanshurukum across the land and the sea until when you are in ships and they sail with them there is a shift of address from second to third person with a fair gentle breeze and they rejoice therein there comes upon them a stormy wind blowing violently destroying everything and waves come on them from every side and they think that they are overwhelmed that is that they shall perish they call upon God secure in their faith their supplication only to Him ‘If la-in the lām is for oaths You deliver us from these terrors we shall verily be of the thankful’ of those who affirm Your Oneness.
Jonah,10,23,"Yet when He hath delivered them, behold! they rebel in the earth wrongfully. O mankind! Your rebellion is only against yourselves. (Ye have) enjoyment of the life of the world; then unto Us is your return and We shall proclaim unto you what ye used to do.",Yet when He has delivered them behold! they are insolent in the earth wrongfully by associating others with God. O mankind your insolence wrongdoing is only against yourselves since the sin thereof shall fall against them; it is but the enjoyment of the life of this world which you will enjoy for a short while then to Us is your return after death and We shall inform you of what you used to do and then requite you for it a variant reading for nominative matā‘u has accusative matā‘a ‘an enjoyment’ in other words read as with an omitted verb such as tatamatta‘ūna ‘one which you shall enjoy’.
Jonah,10,24,"The similitude of the life of the world is only as water which We send down from the sky, then the earth’s growth of that which men and cattle eat mingleth with it till, when the earth hath taken on her ornaments and is embellished, and her people deem that they are masters of her, Our commandment cometh by night or by day and We make it as reaped corn as if it had not flourished yesterday. Thus do we expound the revelations for people who reflect.",The likeness the description of the life of this world is only as water rain which We send down from the heaven then the plants of the earth mingle with it they mingle because of it attaching themselves one to another whereof mankind eat plants such as wheat and barley and so on and cattle eat of pasture until when the earth has taken on its ornaments its splendour of plants and has adorned itself with flowers izzayyanat ‘adorned itself’ is originally tazayyanat but the tā’ has been substituted with the zāy and assimilated with it and its inhabitants think that they are masters of it fully capable of harvesting its fruits Our command Our decree or Our chastisement comes upon it by night or day and We make it that is its crops as reaped corn like that which has been reaped with sickles as though ka-an is softened in other words read it as ka-annahā the previous day it had not flourished as though it never were. Thus do We detail do We make clear the signs for a people who reflect.
Jonah,10,25,"And Allah summoneth to the abode of peace, and leadeth whom He will to a straight path.",And God summons to the Abode of Peace that is the Abode of security which is Paradise by summoning people to faith and He guides whomever He wills that he be guided to a straight path the religion of Islam.
Jonah,10,26,For those who do good is the best (reward) and more (thereto). Neither dust nor ignominy cometh near their faces. Such are rightful owners of the Garden; they will abide therein.,For those who do good by having faith is the fairest reward Paradise and more which is to contemplate God exalted be He as reported in a hadīth by Muslim in his Sahīh; neither dust soot nor ignominy grief shall overcome envelop their faces. Those they are the inhabitants of Paradise therein they will abide.
Jonah,10,27,"And those who earn ill-deeds, (for them) requital of each ill-deed by the like thereof; and ignominy overtaketh them - They have no protector from Allah - as if their faces had been covered with a cloak of darkest night. Such are rightful owners of the Fire; they will abide therein.",And for those wa’lladhīna is a supplement to li’lladhīna ahsanū ‘for those who do good’ so understand it as wa-li’lladhīna ‘and for those’ who earn evil deeds by practising idolatry there shall be the requital of an evil deed by the like thereof; ignominy shall overcome them — they have no protector no defender against God — as if their faces had been covered with cloaked in strips of darkest night read qita‘an as the plural of qit‘a; or qit‘an meaning juz’an ‘a part’. Those they are the inhabitants of the Fire therein they will abide.
Jonah,10,28,"On the day when We gather them all together, then We say unto those who ascribed partners (unto Us): Stand back, ye and your (pretended) partners (of Allah)! And We separate them, the one from the other, and their (pretended) partners say: It was not us ye worshipped.",And mention the day on which We shall gather them that is creation all together then We shall say to those who associated others with God ‘In your place! makānakum is in the accusative because ilzamū ‘adhere to’ is implied sc. ilzamū makānakum. You antum this emphasises the second person plural subject concealed in the implied verb ilzamū and allows for the supplement that follows and your associates!’ that is the idols. Then We shall make a separation We shall distinguish between them and the believers as is stated in the verse wa’mtāzū’l-yawma ayyuhā’l-mujrimūn ‘Now be separate you sinners upon this day!’ Q. 3659; and their associates will say to them ‘It was not us that you were worshipping mā of mā-kuntum ‘you were not …’ is for negation; the direct object iyyānā ‘us’ precedes the verb in order to accord with the end-rhyme of the Qur’ānic verse;
Jonah,10,29,"Allah sufficeth as a witness between us and you, that we were unaware of your worship.",God suffices as a witness between us and you that indeed in is softened so read as innā we were unaware of your worship’.
Jonah,10,30,"There doth every soul experience that which it did aforetime, and they are returned unto Allah, their rightful Lord, and that which they used to invent hath failed them.",There that is on that day every soul shall experience tablū derives from balwā ‘a trial’; a variant reading has tatlū ‘it shall recite’ derived from tilāwa ‘recitation’ what it did before what it offered in the way of deeds and they shall be returned to God their rightful their established everlasting Lord and that which they were inventing of lies against Him in the way of associates shall fail them shall be absent before them.
Jonah,10,31,"Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Who provideth for you from the sky and the earth, or Who owneth hearing and sight; and Who bringeth forth the living from the dead and bringeth forth the dead from the living; and Who directeth the course ? They will say: Allah. Then say: Will ye not then keep your duty (unto Him) ?",Say to them ‘Who provides for you rain out of the heaven and plants out of the earth or Who owns hearing meaning the ability to make hear that is the creation of this faculty and sight and Who brings forth the living from the dead and brings forth the dead from the living and Who directs affairs?’ between creatures? They will surely say ‘It is He God.’ Then say to them ‘Will you not then fear?’ Him and believe?
Jonah,10,32,"Such then is Allah, your rightful Lord. After the Truth what is there saving error ? How then are ye turned away!",That Doer of all these things then is God your true established Lord so what is there after truth except error? the interrogative is meant as an affirmative in other words there is nothing after it truth other than that error; thus he who mistakes the truth which is the worship of God has fallen into error. How then are you turned away from faith despite the proofs having been established?
Jonah,10,33,Thus is the Word of thy Lord justified concerning those who do wrong: that they believe not.,Thus just as those are turned away from faith so the Word of your Lord is justified concerning those who are wicked those who disbelieve and this Word is either the verse Q. 3213‘Verily I shall fill Hell with jinn and mankind together’ or it is the following that they do not believe.
Jonah,10,34,"Say: Is there of your partners (whom ye ascribe unto Allah) one that produceth Creation and then reproduceth it ? Say: Allah produceth Creation, then reproduceth it. How then, are ye misled!",Say ‘Is there of those whom you associate with God one that originates creation then recreated it?’ Say ‘God originates creation then recreates it. How then are you deviated?’ turned away from worshipping Him despite proof having been established.
Jonah,10,35,"Say: Is there of your partners (whom ye ascribe unto Allah) one that leadeth to the Truth ? Say: Allah leadeth to the Truth. Is He Who leadeth to the Truth more deserving that He should be followed, or he who findeth not the way unless he (himself) be guided. What aileth you ? How judge ye ?",Say ‘Is there of those whom you associate with God one that guides to the truth?’ by means of setting up definitive arguments and creating guidance. Say ‘God guides to the truth; is One Who guides to the truth — and this is God — more deserving of being followed or one who does not guide one who is not himself guided unless he is guided? more deserving of being followed? the interrogative is meant as an affirmation and a rebuke in other words the former is more deserving. So what is wrong with you how do you judge?’ how do you make this corrupt judgement one where what does not deserve to be followed is followed?
Jonah,10,36,Most of them follow not but conjecture. Assuredly conjecture can by no means take the place of truth. Lo! Allah is Aware of what they do.,And most of them in worshipping idols follow nothing but conjecture since they imitate their fathers therein; truly conjecture avails nothing against truth when what is sought is knowledge. Surely God is Knower of what they do and will requite them for it.
Jonah,10,37,And this Qur’an is not such as could ever be invented in despite of Allah; but it is a confirmation of that which was before it and an exposition of that which is decreed for mankind - Therein is no doubt - from the Lord of the Worlds.,And this Qur’ān is not such as could ever be produced that is it could not be a fabrication by anyone besides God; but it is revealed as a confirmation of what is before it of Scriptures and a detailing of the Book a exposition of the rulings and other matters which God has prescribed — wherein is no doubt no uncertainty — from the Lord of the Worlds min rabbi’l-‘ālamīn is semantically connected to tasdīqa ‘a confirmation’ or to an omitted unzila ‘revealed’; a variant reading for accusative tasdīqa has the nominative tasdīqu and nominative tafsīlu ‘a detailing’ for the accusative tafsīla by reading an implied huwa ‘it is’.
Jonah,10,38,"Or say they: He hath invented it ? Say: Then bring a surah like unto it, and call (for help) on all ye can besides Allah, if ye are truthful.",Or do they say ‘He has invented it’? Muhammad (s) has invented it. Say ‘Then bring a sūra like it in terms of the clarity and the rhetorical excellence of its language by way of invention for you are eloquent speakers of Arabic like me; and call upon whom you can for help in this matter besides God that is other than Him if you are truthful’ in saying that this is an invention. But they were not able to do this.
Jonah,10,39,"Nay, but they denied that, the knowledge whereof they could not compass, and whereof the interpretation (in events) hath not yet come unto them. Even so did those before them deny. Then see what was the consequence for the wrong-doers!",God exalted be He says Nay but they denied that the knowledge whereof they did not comprehend that is they denied the Qur’ān and did not reflected upon it; and whereof the interpretation the consequence of the threats made therein has not yet come to them. So in the same manner of denial those who were before them denied their messengers. Behold then what was the consequence for the evildoers! for denying the messengers in other words behold how their affair was concluded by their being destroyed. In a similar manner We shall destroy these people.
Jonah,10,40,"And of them is he who believeth therein, and of them is he who believeth not therein, and thy Lord is Best Aware of the corrupters.",And of them that is of the people of Mecca are some who believe in it God being aware of this in their case and some who would never believe therein. And your Lord knows very well the corrupters this is a threat for them.
Jonah,10,41,"And if they deny thee, say: Unto me my work, and unto you your work. Ye are innocent of what I do, and I am innocent of what ye do.",If they deny you then say to them ‘Unto me is my work and to you your work that is for each there will be a due requital of his deeds; you are innocent of what I do and I am innocent of what you do’ this was abrogated by the ‘sword’ verse Q. 95.
Jonah,10,42,And of them are some who listen unto thee. But canst thou make the deaf to hear even though they apprehend not ?,And of them are some who listen to you when you recite the Qur’ān. But will you make the deaf to hear — He likens them the Meccan disbelievers to these the deaf because they are not able to benefit from what is recited to them — even though with their deafness they do not understand? even though they do not reflect?
Jonah,10,43,And of them is he who looketh toward thee. But canst thou guide the blind even though they see not ?,And of them are some who look toward you. But will you guide the blind even though they do not see? — He likens them the Meccan disbelievers to these the blind because they fail to be guided nay they are much worse since God says It is not the eyes that are blind but blind are the hearts within the breasts Q. 2246.
Jonah,10,44,Lo! Allah wrongeth not mankind in aught; but mankind wrong themselves.,Verily God does not wrong mankind in any way but mankind wrong themselves.
Jonah,10,45,"And on the day when He shall gather them together, (when it will seem) as though they had tarried but an hour of the day, recognising one another, those will verily have perished who denied the meeting with Allah and were not guided.",And on the day when He shall gather them it is as if they had not tarried in this world or in the grave but an hour of the day because of the terror of what they see the comparative sentence is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the third person pronoun; recognising one another knowing one another upon their being resurrected but thereafter the recognition ceases on account of the severity of the terrors the last sentence is either an implied circumstantial qualifier or one connected to the adverbial qualifier yawma ‘on the day’; those will verily have lost who denied the encounter with God through resurrection for they were not guided.
Jonah,10,46,"Whether We let thee (O Muhammad) behold something of that which We promise them or (whether We) cause thee to die, still unto Us is their return, and Allah, moreover, is Witness over what they do.",And whether wa-immā the nūn of the conditional particle in has been assimiliated with the extra mā We show you something of that which We promise them of chastisement during your lifetime the response to the conditional statement has been omitted in other words understand it as being fa-dhāka ‘then so shall it be’ or We take you to Us before punishing them to Us they shall return and God moreover is Witness Aware of what they do in the way of their denials and disbelief and so will chastise them with the severest punishment.
Jonah,10,47,"And for every nation there is a messenger. And when their messenger cometh (on the Day of Judgment) it will be judged between them fairly, and they will not be wronged.",And for every community of the communities of this world there is a messenger. And when their messenger comes to them and they deny him judgement is passed between them justly fairly such that they are punished and the messenger and all those who accepted his truthfulness are delivered; and they are not wronged by being punished for no crime similarly We shall deal with these disbelievers of your community.
Jonah,10,48,"And they say: When will this promise be fulfilled, if ye are truthful ?",And they say ‘When will this promise of chastisement come to pass if you are truthful about it?’
Jonah,10,49,"Say: I have no power to hurt or benefit myself, save that which Allah willeth. For every nation there is an appointed time. When their time cometh, then they cannot put it off an hour, nor hasten (it).",Say ‘I have no power to avert hurt from myself or to bring benefit except as God might will to give me power over so how could I possess the power to bring about the chastisement? For every community there is an appointed time a fixed period until they perish. When their time comes they cannot put it off they will not miss it by a single hour nor bring it forward nor overtake it’.
Jonah,10,50,"Say: Have ye thought: When His doom cometh unto you as a raid by night, or in the (busy) day; what is there of it that the guilty ones desire to hasten ?",Say ‘Have you considered? Say inform me If His God’s chastisement comes upon you by night or day what part is there of it that is of the chastisement that the sinners the idolaters seek to hasten? an overt noun al-mujrimūn ‘the sinners’ has replaced the second person ‘you’ pronominalisation. The interrogative sentence is the response to the conditional as in the case where you might say ‘If I come to you what would you give me?’; the intention here is to provoke terror in them in other words how awful is that which they seek to hasten!
Jonah,10,51,"Is it (only) then, when it hath befallen you, that ye will believe ? What! (Believe) now, when (until now) ye have been hastening it on (through disbelief) ?",Is it only then when it has come to pass when it has befallen you that you will believe therein? that is in God or it means in the chastisement when it has come down the use of hamza in a-thumma ‘is it then’ is to deny the possibility of deferrment of chastisement in other words it your belief will not be accepted from you in that instance and it will be said to you Now do you believe when until now you have been hastening it on?’ in mockery of it.
Jonah,10,52,Then will it be said unto those who dealt unjustly Taste the torment of eternity. Are ye requited aught save what ye used to earn ?,Then will it be said to those who were evildoers ‘Taste the everlasting chastisement! that is the one in which you shall abide. Are you you are not requited for anything but the requital of what you used to earn?’
Jonah,10,53,"And they ask thee to inform them (saying): Is it true ? Say: Yea, by my Lord, verily it is true, and ye cannot escape.",And they ask you to tell to inform them ‘Is it true?’ that which you promise us in the way of chastisement and resurrection? Say ‘Aye indeed by my Lord! Verily it is true and you cannot escape’ you cannot elude the chastisement.
Jonah,10,54,"And if each soul that doeth wrong had all that is in the earth it would seek to ransom itself therewith; and they will feel remorse within them, when they see the doom. But it hath been judged between them fairly and they are not wronged.",And if each soul that has done wrong that has disbelieved had all that is in the earth of riches it would offer it as ransom against chastisement on the Day of Resurrection; and they will feel remorse within them for having neglected faith when they see the chastisement their leaders keep it their remorse secret from the weak ones whom they had led astray fearing reproach but it has been decided justly between them between all creatures and they are not wronged in anything.
Jonah,10,55,Lo! verily all that is in the heavens and the earth is Allah’s. Lo! verily Allah’s promise is true. But most of them know not.,Why surely to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth. Why surely God’s promise of resurrection and requital is true is fixed but most of them people do not know this.
Jonah,10,56,"He quickeneth and giveth death, and unto Him ye will be returned.",He gives life and makes to die and to Him you shall be returned in the Hereafter and He shall requite you for your deeds.
Jonah,10,57,"O mankind! There hath come unto you an exhortation from your Lord, a balm for that which is in the breasts, a guidance and a mercy for believers.",O people that is inhabitants of Mecca there has come to you an admonition from your Lord a Book which contains mention of that which is permissible for you and that which is enjoined on you and this Book is the Qur’ān; and a healing a cure for what is in the breasts of corrupt beliefs and uncertainties and a guidance from error and a mercy for those who believe in it.
Jonah,10,58,Say: In the bounty of Allah and in His mercy: therein let them rejoice. It is better than what they hoard.,Say ‘In the bounty of God that is Islam and in His mercy the Qur’ān in that bounty and mercy let them rejoice it is better than what they hoard’ in this world read yajma‘ūn ‘they hoard’ and tajma‘ūn ‘you hoard’.
Jonah,10,59,"Say: Have ye considered what provision Allah hath sent down for you, how ye have made of it lawful and unlawful ? Hath Allah permitted you, or do ye invent a lie concerning Allah ?",Say ‘Have you considered inform me what provision God has revealed has created for you how you have made some of it unlawful and some lawful?’ as in the case of the camels called al-Bahīra or al-Sā’iba and carrion. Say ‘Has God given you permission to make that lawful or unlawful? No! Or do you nay you invent lies concerning God?’ by attributing that to Him.
Jonah,10,60,"And what think those who invent a lie concerning Allah (will be their plight) upon the Day of Resurrection ? Lo! Allah truly is Bountiful toward mankind, but most of them give not thanks.",And what do they suppose those who invent lies concerning God will happen to them on the Day of Resurrection? do they reckon that He will not chastise them? No! Truly God is Bountiful to mankind by granting them respite and bestowing graces upon them but most of them do not give thanks.
Jonah,10,61,"And thou (Muhammad) art not occupied with any business and thou recitest not a Lecture from this (Scripture), and ye (mankind) perform no act, but We are Witness of you when ye are engaged therein. And not an atom’s weight in the earth or in the sky escapeth your Lord, nor what is less than that or greater than that, but it is (written) in a clear Book.",And you O Muhammad (s) are not occupied with any business any matter nor do you recite anything regarding it that is regarding such a matter — or it means nor do you recite anything from God by way of the Qur’ān which He has revealed to you nor do you perform any action God is addressing him and his community but We are witnesses watchers over you when you are engaged therein that is in the action. And not so much as the weight of an atom the weight of the smallest ant in the earth or in the heaven escapes is hidden from your Lord nor what is less than that or greater but it is in a clear a manifest Book namely the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz.
Jonah,10,62,"Lo! verily the friends of Allah are (those) on whom fear (cometh) not, nor do they grieve ?",Assuredly God’s friends no fear shall befall them neither shall they grieve in the Hereafter.
Jonah,10,63,Those who believe and keep their duty (to Allah).,They are those who believe and fear God by observing His commandments and prohibitions.
Jonah,10,64,Theirs are good tidings in the life of the world and in the Hereafter - There is no changing the Words of Allah - that is the Supreme Triumph.,Theirs are good tidings in the life of this world in a hadīth verified by al-Hākim this has been explained as referring to a propitious vision which an individual might have or a vision which another might have of that person; and in the Hereafter Paradise and reward. There is no changing the Words of God no failing of His promises; that mentioned is the supreme triumph.
Jonah,10,65,"And let not their speech grieve thee (O Muhammad). Lo! power belongeth wholly to Allah. He is the Hearer, the Knower.",And let not what they say to you that you have not been sent as a prophet or otherwise grieve you. Truly inna indicates a new sentence power might belongs wholly to God. He is the Hearer of speech the Knower of deeds and will requite them and grant you victory.
Jonah,10,66,"Lo! is it not unto Allah that belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and whosoever is in the earth ? Those who follow aught instead of Allah follow not (His) partners. They follow only a conjecture, and they do but guess.",Why surely to God belongs all who are in the heavens and all who are in the earth as servants possessions and creatures. Those who call upon those who worship besides God that is other than Him idols are not following associates of His in reality exalted be He above this they are following nothing but conjecture in this matter that is their supposition that these are gods who intercede for them and they are only telling lies in this matter.
Jonah,10,67,He it is Who hath appointed for you the night that ye should rest therein and the day giving sight. Lo! herein verily are portents for a folk that heed.,He it is Who made for you the night that you should rest therein and the day to see the attribution of sight ibsār to ‘the day’ is figurative since one is able to see during it. Surely in that are signs indications of His Oneness exalted be He for a folk who are able to hear hearing in such a way so as to reflect and be admonished.
Jonah,10,68,They say: Allah hath taken (unto Him) a son - Glorified be He! He hath no needs! His is all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. Ye have no warrant for this. Tell ye concerning Allah that which ye know not ?,They that is the Jews and the Christians and those who claim that the angels are the daughters of God say ‘God has taken to Him a son’. God exalted be He says to them Glory be to Him! in affirmation of His transcending having offspring. He is Independent without need of anyone for only he who has need of a child would desire to have one. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth as possessions creatures and servants. You have no warrant no proof for this that you say. Do you say about God what you do not know? an interrogative meant as a rebuke.
Jonah,10,69,Say: Verily those who invent a lie concerning Allah will not succeed.,Say ‘Truly those who invent lies concerning God by attributing offspring to Him shall not prosper’ they shall not find happiness.
Jonah,10,70,"This world’s portion (will be theirs), then unto Us is their return. Then We make them taste a dreadful doom because they used to disbelieve.",Theirs will be enjoyment only a little in this world which they will enjoy for the duration of their lives then to Us is their return at death then We shall make them taste terrible chastisement after death because they used to disbelieve.
Jonah,10,71,"Recite unto them the story of Noah, when he told his people: O my people! If my sojourn (here) and my reminding you by Allah’s revelations are an offence unto you, in Allah have I put my trust, so decide upon your course of action you and your partners. Let not your course of action be in doubt for you. Then have at me, give me no respite.",And recite O Muhammad (s) to them that is to the Meccan disbelievers the story the tale of Noah Nūhin is substituted by the following idh qāla when he said to his people ‘O my people if my sojourn my stay among you is too great to bear is a hardship for you as is my reminding you my admonishing you by the signs of God in God have I put my trust; so decide upon your course of action resolve upon what you will do to me together with your associates wa-shurakā’akum the wāw wa- means here ‘with’ then let not your decision be a secret between you concealed nay manifest it and proclaim it to me; then implement it against me carry out what you desire and do not put it off do not give me respite for I am not concerned by you.
Jonah,10,72,"But if ye are averse I have asked of you no wage. My wage is the concern of Allah only, and I am commanded to be of those who surrender (unto Him).",But if you turn away from my reminding you I have not asked you for any wage any reward for it so turn and go away my wage my reward falls only on God and I have been commanded to be of those who submit to God’.
Jonah,10,73,"But they denied him, so We saved him and those with him in the ship, and made them viceroys (in the earth), while We drowned those who denied Our revelations. See then the nature of the consequence for those who had been warned.",But they denied him so We saved him and those with him in the Ark and made them that is those with him successors in the earth and We drowned those who denied Our signs by unleashing the Flood. Behold then the nature of the consequence for those who had been warned! in that they were destroyed likewise We deal with those who deny.
Jonah,10,74,"Then, after him, We sent messengers unto their folk, and they brought them clear proofs. But they were not ready to believe in that which they before denied. Thus print We on the hearts of the transgressors.",Then after him that is after Noah We sent messengers to their people such as Abraham Hūd and Sālih and they brought them clear proofs miracles but it was not for them to believe in that which they had denied before that is before the sending of messengers to them. Thus do We seal stamp upon the hearts of the transgressors — so that they cannot accept faith — in the same way that We sealed the hearts of those before.
Jonah,10,75,"Then, after them, We sent Moses and Aaron unto Pharaoh and his chiefs with Our revelations, but they were arrogant and were a guilty folk.",Then after them We sent Moses and Aaron to Pharaoh and his council that is his folk with Our nine signs but they were disdainful to believe in them and were a sinful folk.
Jonah,10,76,"And when the Truth from Our presence came unto them, they said: Lo! this is mere magic.",So when the Truth came to them from Us they said ‘Surely this is manifest sorcery’ sorcery that is clear and evident.
Jonah,10,77,Moses said: Speak ye (so) of the Truth when it hath come unto you ? Is this magic ? Now magicians thrive not.,Moses said ‘Do you say so of the Truth when it has come to you that it is sorcery? Is this sorcery? when the one who has brought it has indeed prospered and has invalidated the sorcery of the sorcerers? Now sorcerers do not prosper’ the interrogative in both instances is meant as a disavowal.
Jonah,10,78,"They said: Hast thou come unto us to pervert us from that (faith) in which we found our fathers, and that you two may own the place of greatness in the land ? We will not believe you two.",They said ‘Have you come to us to divert us to turn us away from what we found our fathers following and that yours both might be the greatness the kingship in the land the land of Egypt? We will not believe you two’.
Jonah,10,79,And Pharaoh said: Bring every cunning wizard unto me.,And Pharaoh said ‘Bring me every cunning sorcerer’ every individual excelling in the art of sorcery.
Jonah,10,80,"And when the wizards came, Moses said unto them: Cast your cast!",And when the sorcerers came Moses said to them after they had said to him Either you cast or we shall be the casters! Q. 7115 ‘Cast your cast!’
Jonah,10,81,"And when they had cast, Moses said: That which ye have brought is magic. Lo! Allah will make it vain. Lo! Allah upholdeth not the work of mischief-makers..",Then when they had cast their ropes and staffs Moses said ‘What mā is interrogative and the subject its predicate being the following ji’tum bihi have you brought? Sorcery? ā’l-sihru a-al-sihru is a substitute for the predicate ji’tum bihi ‘have you brought’; a variant reading has al-sihru with a single hamza making it predicative in which case mā is the relative particle of the subject Verily God will bring it to nothing He will efface it.

Do ye twain keep to the straight path, and follow not the road of those who have no knowledge.",He God exalted be He said ‘Your prayer has been answered thus their riches were transformed into stones and Pharaoh did not believe until he was about to drown.

Jonah,10,90,"And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh with his hosts pursued them in rebellion and transgression, till, when the (fate of) drowning overtook him, he exclaimed: I believe that there is no God save Him in Whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of those who surrender (unto Him).",And We brought the Children of Israel across the sea; and Pharaoh pursued them he caught up with them together with his hosts in insolence and transgression baghyan wa-‘adwan these constitute the direct object denoting reason until when the fate of drowning overtook him he said ‘I believe that annahu is to be understood as bi-annahu; a variant reading has innahu ‘truly it is …’ indicating a new sentence there is no god save Him in whom the Children of Israel believe and I am of those who submit to Him’ he reiterated this his submission to God so that it might be accepted from him but it was not; and Gabriel thrust mud from the sea into his mouth lest God’s mercy embrace him.

Hûd,11,37,"Build the ship under Our eyes and by Our inspiration, and speak not unto Me on behalf of those who do wrong. Lo! they will be drowned.",Build the Ark the ship under Our eyes under Our watch and protection and by Our inspiration by Our command and do not address Me concerning those who have done evil those who have disbelieved by asking that I should refrain from destroying them; lo! they shall be drowned’.
Hûd,11,38,"And he was building the ship, and every time that chieftains of his people passed him, they made mock of him. He said: Though ye make mock of Us, yet We mock at you even as ye mock;",And he was building the Ark yasna‘ is narrating a past state in the present tense and whenever a council a group of his people passed him they scoffed at him mocked him. He said ‘Though you scoff at us yet we scoff at you even as you scoff when we are saved while you drown;
Hûd,11,39,"And ye shall know to whom a punishment that will confound him cometh, and upon whom a lasting doom will fall.",and you shall know to whom man introduces the relative clause which constitutes the direct object of the action of ‘knowing’ will come a chastisement degrading him and upon whom an enduring an everlasting chastisement will fall’.
Hûd,11,40,"(Thus it was) till, when Our commandment came to pass and the oven gushed forth water, We said: Load therein two of every kind, a pair (the male and female), and thy household, save him against whom the word hath gone forth already, and those who believe. And but a few were they who believed with him.",Such that when hattā represents the objective for the action of ‘building’ Our command came for their destruction and the baker’s oven gushed forth with water — this was the sign for Noah — We said ‘Load therein in the ship of every kind of every male and female that is of every species of these two two a male and a female ithnayn constitutes the direct object. According to the story God gathered for Noah all the beasts of prey and birds and other animals; he Noah would go through every species to select them with his hands and his right hand would fall upon a male and the left upon a female whereupon he would take them aboard the ship; and your family — that is his wife and children — save those against whom the Word has already gone forth from among them that they be destroyed this was his wife and his son Canaan in contrast with Shem Ham and Japheth whom he took aboard together with their three wives and those who believe’. And none but a few believed with him it is said that these were six men and their wives; it is also said that the number of all those aboard the ship was eighty half of whom were men and the other half women.
Hûd,11,41,"And he said: Embark therein! In the name of Allah be its course and its mooring. Lo! my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.",And he Noah said ‘Embark therein! In the Name of God be its course and its mooring read majrāhā and marsāhā or mujrāhā and mursāhā both being verbal nouns meaning the length of its course and where it docks in other words the entire journey. Truly my Lord is Forgiving Merciful’ for He did not destroy us.
Hûd,11,42,"And it sailed with them amid waves like mountains, and Noah cried unto his son - and he was standing aloof - O my son! Come ride with us, and be not with the disbelievers.",And it sailed with them amid waves like mountains in terms of their height and size and Noah called out to his son Canaan who was standing away from the ship ‘O my son embark with us and do not be with the disbelievers!’
Hûd,11,43,"He said: I shall betake me to some mountain that will save me from the water. (Noah) said: This day there is none that saveth from the commandment of Allah save him on whom He hath had mercy. And the wave came in between them, so he was among the drowned.",He said ‘I shall take refuge in a mountain that will protect me preserve me from the water’. Said he ‘This day there is none that can protect from God’s command from His chastisement except — but — him on whom He God has mercy’ he will be protected. God exalted be He says And the waves came between them so he was among the drowned.
Hûd,11,44,"And it was said: O earth! Swallow thy water and, O sky! be cleared of clouds! And the water was made to subside. And the commandment was fulfilled. And it (the ship) came to rest upon (the mount) Al-Judi and it was said: A far removal for wrongdoing folk!",And it was said ‘O earth swallow your waters that have sprung forth from you — and it reabsorbed it all except for what came down from the sky and formed rivers and seas — and O heaven abate!’ withhold the rain and it did. And the waters subsided decreased. And the affair was accomplished the matter of the destruction of Noah’s people was complete and it settled and the ship came to rest upon al-Jūdī a mountain in Mespotamia al-jazīra near Mosul; and it was said ‘Away with — perish — the evildoing the disbelieving folk!’
Hûd,11,45,And Noah cried unto his Lord and said: My Lord! Lo! my son is of my household! Surely Thy promise is the truth and Thou are the Most Just of Judges.,And Noah called out to his Lord and said ‘My Lord lo! my son Canaan is of my family and You promised me that they would be saved and truly Your promise is the Truth which never fails and You are the Most Just of Judges’ the most knowledgeable and the fairest of them.
Hûd,11,46,"He said: O Noah! Lo! he is not of thy household; lo! he is of evil conduct, so ask not of Me that whereof thou hast no knowledge. I admonish thee lest thou be among the ignorant.",He God exalted be He said ‘O Noah lo! he is not of your family of those who will be saved or of the followers of your religion; lo! it that is your asking me to save him is not a righteous deed for he is a disbeliever and there is no deliverance for disbelievers ‘āmalun ghayru sālihin ‘it is not a righteous deed’ a variant reading has ‘āmila the verb with ghayra in the accusative in which case the person governing the verb ‘amila is his son. So do not ask of Me read either fa-lā tas’alanni or fa-lā tas’alni that whereof you have no knowledge in respect to saving your son. I admonish you lest you be among the ignorant’ when you ask about what you do not know.
Hûd,11,47,He said: My Lord! Lo! in Thee do I seek refuge (from the sin) that I should ask of Thee that whereof I have no knowledge. Unless Thou forgive me and have mercy on me I shall be among the lost.,He said ‘My Lord I seek refuge in You from the sin that I should ask of You that whereof I have no knowledge. Unless You forgive me my excess and have mercy on me I shall be among the losers’.
Hûd,11,48,It was said (unto him): O Noah! Go thou down (from the mountain) with peace from Us and blessings upon thee and some nations (that will spring) from those with thee. (There will be other) nations unto whom We shall give enjoyment a long while and then a painful doom from Us will overtake them.,It was said ‘O Noah go down disembark from the ship in peace in safety or with a greeting from Us and blessings good things upon you and upon some communities that will spring from those with you in the ship that is from their children and their seed those who are and those who will be the believers. And there will be other communities read umamun to spring from those with you to whom We shall give enjoyment in this world and then a painful chastisement will befall them’ in the Hereafter and these will be the disbelievers.
Hûd,11,49,"This is of the tidings of the Unseen which We inspire in thee (Muhammad). Thou thyself knewest it not, nor did thy folk (know it) before this. Then have patience. Lo! the sequel is for those who ward off (evil).",Those that is these verses containing stories such as the story of Noah are of the tidings of the Unseen of the tales of that which was hidden from you which We inspire in you O Muhammad (s). You yourself did not know it nor did your people know it before this Qur’ān. So be patient in conveying the Message and in enduring your people’s hurt as Noah endured. Truly the praiseworthy sequel is for those who are God-fearing.
Hûd,11,50,"And unto (the tribe of) A’ad (We sent) their brother, Hud. He said: O my people! Serve Allah! Ye have no other God save Him. Lo! ye do but invent.",And We sent to ‘Ād their brother from the tribe Hūd. He said ‘O my people worship God! affirm His Oneness. You have no god min ilāhin min is extra other than He. You in your worship of graven images do but invent you do but invent lies against God.

Thou hast brought us no clear proof and we are not going to forsake our gods on thy (mere) saying, and we are not believers in thee.",They said ‘O Hūd you have not brought us any clear proof any evidence for what you say and we are not going to forsake our gods on the basis of your saying that is because of what you say and we are not believers in you.

He said: I call Allah to witness, and do ye (too) bear witness, that I am innocent of (all) that ye ascribe as partners (to Allah)",We say nothing concerning you save that one of our gods has possessed you in some evil way’ rendering you insane for your having cursed them and so you are raving.

Hûd,11,59,And such were A’ad. They denied the revelations of their Lord and flouted His messengers and followed the command of every froward potentate.,And that was ‘Ād — this is an allusion to their remains; in other words go forth in the land and look at these remains. God then describes their case saying they knowingly denied the signs of their Lord and disobeyed His messengers rusulahu is in the plural because when a person disobeys a messenger he has effectively disobeyed all of them since they share a common principle in that Message with which they come namely the principle of God’s Oneness; and they that is the riffraff followed the command of every rebellious tyrant every leader of theirs who is obstinate with regard to the truth.

Hûd,11,102,"Even thus is the grasp of thy Lord when He graspeth the townships while they are doing wrong. Lo! His grasp is painful, very strong.",Such like that seizing is the seizing of your Lord when He seizes the towns meaning its inhabitants while they are doing wrong by way of sins in other words nothing can avail them in any way when He seizes them. Truly His seizing is painful severe. The two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim reported by way of an isnād from Abū Mūsā al-Ash‘arī that he said ‘The Prophet s said “God gives extended respite to the evildoer but when He seizes him there is no escape for him” whereupon the Prophet s recited the verse Such is the seizing of your Lord Q. 11102 above’.

Lo! we shall pay them their whole due unabated.,So do not be O Muhammad (s) in doubt in uncertainty concerning what these folk worship of idols We will indeed chastise them as We did those before them — this is intended as solace for the Prophet s.

Hûd,11,110,"And we verily gave unto Moses the Scripture, and there was strife thereupon; and had it not been for a Word that had already gone forth from thy Lord, the case would have been judged between them, and lo! they are in grave doubt concerning it.",And We verily gave Moses the Scripture the Torah but differences arose concerning it some believing others denying just as is the case with the Qur’ān; and were it not for a word that went forth from your Lord to defer the reckoning and the requital for creatures to the Day of Resurrection the case would have been decided between them in this world regarding that over which they differed; and truly they that is those who deny it are in grave doubt concerning it doubt creating great uncertainty.

This is reminder for the mindful.,And establish prayer at the two ends of the day at first light and before sunset that is pray in the morning at noon and in the afternoon and in some watches zulafan is the plural of zulfa a portion of the night that is at sunset and late evening.

The wrong-doers followed that by which they were made sapless, and were guilty.",If only there had been among the generations past communities before you men possessing a remnant of good sense men of religion and virtue forbidding corruption in the earth this statement is intended to be a negation in other words ‘there never were such men among them’ except but a few of those whom mimman min is explicative We delivered from among them did forbid corruption and were thus delivered. But those who did wrong through corruption and neglecting to forbid followed that by which they were made profligate and were sinners.
Hûd,11,117,In truth thy Lord destroyed not the townships tyrannously while their folk were doing right.,Yet your Lord would never destroy the towns through injustice on His part against them while their inhabitants were righteous that is believers.

Hûd,11,119,Save him on whom thy Lord hath mercy; and for that He did create them. And the Word of thy Lord hath been fulfilled: Verily I shall fill hell with the jinn and mankind together.,except those on whom your Lord has mercy those for whom He desires good and so they do not differ in it — and that is why He created them that is He created those of difference for that in other words so that they should differ and those deserving mercy for that in other words so that they should receive mercy. And the Word of your Lord has been fulfilled namely ‘I will surely fill Hell with jinn and mankind together’.
Hûd,11,120,And all that We relate unto thee of the story of the messengers is in order that thereby We may make firm thy heart. And herein hath come unto thee the Truth and an exhortation and a reminder for believers.,And all that kullān is in the accusative because it is the direct object of naqussu ‘We relate’; and the nunation compensates for a missing genitive annexation that is all that is necessary We relate to you of the accounts of the messengers that mā substitutes for kullan ‘all that’ with which We might strengthen reassure your heart. And in these accounts or verses there has come to you the Truth and an admonition and a reminder to the believers they are specifically mentioned here because they are the ones to benefit from them through their belief in them in contrast to the case with the disbelievers.

So worship Him affirm His Oneness and rely on Him trust in Him for He is sufficient for you and your Lord is not heedless of what they do but He defers dealing with them until their appointed time a variant reading has ta‘malūn ‘what you do’.
Joseph,12,1,Alif. Lam. Ra. These are verse of the Scripture that maketh plain.,Alif lām rā’ God knows best what He means by these letters. Those verses are the verses of the Book the Qur’ān the genitive annexation carries the meaning of partitive min ‘from’ that makes plain the one that manifests truth distinguishing it from what is falsehood.
Joseph,12,2,"Lo! We have revealed it, a Lecture in Arabic, that ye may understand.",We have revealed it as an Arabic Qur’ān in the language of the Arabs so that you O people of Mecca might understand comprehend its meaning.
Joseph,12,3,"We narrate unto thee (Muhammad) the best of narratives in that We have inspired in thee this Qur’an, though aforetime thou wast of the heedless.",We will relate to you the best of narratives in what We have revealed in Our revealing to you this Qur’ān though wa-in in is softened in other words understand it as wa-innahu prior to it you were of the heedless.
Joseph,12,4,"When Joseph said unto his father: O my father! Lo! I saw in a dream eleven planets and the sun and the moon, I saw them prostrating themselves unto me.",Mention when Joseph said to his father Jacob ‘O my father read yā abati to indicate the omitted yā’ of genitive annexation sc. of yā abī; or read yā abata to indicate that an alif originally a yā’ has been omitted I saw in my sleep eleven planets and the sun and the moon I saw them repeated for emphasis prostrating themselves before me’ sājidīn this plural form is used to describe the act of ‘prostration’ which is an attribute associated with rational beings.
Joseph,12,5,"He said: O my dear son! Tell not thy brethren of thy vision, lest they plot a plot against thee. Lo! Satan is for man an open foe.",He said ‘O my son do not relate your vision to your brothers lest they plot against you some plot lest they scheme to kill you out of envy knowing that the interpretation of the dream is that they represent the eleven planets your mother the sun and your father the moon. Truly Satan is to man a manifest foe one of evident enmity.
Joseph,12,6,"Thus thy Lord will prefer thee and will teach thee the interpretation of events, and will perfect His grace upon thee and upon the family of Jacob as He perfected it upon thy forefathers, Abraham and Isaac. Lo! thy Lord is Knower, Wise.",Thus in the way that you have seen will your Lord prefer you choose you and teach you the interpretation of events the interpretation of visions and perfect His grace upon you with prophethood and upon the House of Jacob — upon his sons — as He perfected it with prophethood formerly on your fathers Abraham and Isaac.

Joseph,12,7,Verily in Joseph and his brethren are signs (of Allah’s Sovereignty) for the inquiring.,Verily in the tale of Joseph and his brethren — who were eleven — are signs lessons for those who inquire about their tale.
Joseph,12,8,"When they said: Verily Joseph and his brother are dearer to our father than we are, many though we be. Lo! our father is in plain aberration.",Mention when they that is when some of Joseph’s brothers said to some of the others ‘Surely Joseph la-Yūsufu is the subject and his brother his full brother Benjamin are dearer ahabbu is the predicate to our father than we are though we be a hardy band a group. Lo! our father is in plain aberration in manifest error for preferring those two to us.
Joseph,12,9,"(One said): Kill Joseph or cast him to some (other) land, so that your father’s favour may be all for you, and (that) ye may afterward be righteous folk.",Kill Joseph or cast him away into some land that is into some distant land so that your father might be solely concerned with you so that he might turn his attention to you and not be distracted by anyone else and that thereafter that is after killing Joseph or casting him away you might be a righteous folk’ by repenting.
Joseph,12,10,"One among them said: Kill not Joseph but, if ye must be doing, fling him into the depth of the pit; some caravan will find him.",One of them namely Judah said ‘Do not kill Joseph but cast him throw him into the bottom of a well ghayābat al-jubb is the darkest recess of a well; a variant reading has the plural ghayābāt so that some caravan might pick him up if you are to do anything’ of what you desire in the way of separating Joseph from us so content yourselves with this solution.
Joseph,12,11,"They said: O our father! Why wilt thou not trust us with Joseph, when lo! we are good friends to him ?",They said ‘O father what is wrong with you that you do not trust us with Joseph? We are indeed his well-wishers we are indeed only looking out for his best interests.
Joseph,12,12,Send him with us to-morrow that he may enjoy himself and play. And lo! we shall take good care of him.,Send him forth with us tomorrow to the desert to frolic and play read first person plural narta‘ wa-nal‘ab ‘that we might frolic and play’ or third person plural yarta‘ wa-yal‘ab ‘that he might frolic and play’ in other words so that we might be spirited and roam freely. Surely we shall take good care of him’.
Joseph,12,13,"He said: Lo! in truth it saddens me that ye should take him with you, and I fear less the wolf devour him while ye are heedless of him.",He said ‘Lo! It grieves me that you should go with him that is your departure with him grieves me because I would be separated from him and I fear lest the wolf devour him al-dhi’b here represents the genus for their land had many wolves in it while you are heedless of him’ distracted by something else.
Joseph,12,14,"They said: If the wolf should devour him when we are (so strong) a band, then surely we should have already perished.",They said ‘Truly if la-in the lām here is for oaths the wolf were to devour him when we are so hardy a band a group then we indeed are losers!’ incapable of anything. Thus he sent him off with them.
Joseph,12,15,"Then, when they led him off, and were of one mind that they should place him in the depth of the pit, We inspired in him: Thou wilt tell them of this deed of theirs when they know (thee) not.",So when they went off with him and agreed resolved to put him into the bottom of the well the response of lammā ‘when’ has been omitted in other words understand it as being fa‘alū dhālika ‘they did just that’ by taking off his shirt — after having beaten him humiliated him and desiring to kill him — and lowering him in a bucket into the well. When he reached half-way down the well they flung him from the bucket so that he would fall and die but he fell into the water and took refuge near a rock. They then called to him and he responded thinking that they had decided to have mercy on him. They then wanted to smash his head with a rock but Judah prevented them. And We revealed to him in the well through true revelation wahy haqīqa — he was 17 years of age or just under — in order to reassure his heart ‘Truly you shall inform them after this day of this affair this deed of theirs when they are unaware’ of who you are wa-hum lā yash‘urūna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the action of ‘informing’.
Joseph,12,16,And they came weeping to their father in the evening.,And they came to their father in the evening weeping.
Joseph,12,17,"Saying: O our father! We went racing one with another, and left Joseph by our things, and the wolf devoured him, and thou believest not our saying even when we speak the truth.",They said ‘O father we went competing shooting and left Joseph by our things our clothes and the wolf ate him. But you would never believe us even though we speak the truth’ before you you would still have accused us of lying in this story because of your adoration of Joseph so how much more so when you think ill of us?
Joseph,12,18,"And they came with false blood on his shirt. He said: Nay, but your minds have beguiled you into something. (My course is) comely patience. And Allah it is Whose help is to be sought in that (predicament) which ye describe.",And they came with false blood on his shirt ‘alā qamīsihi has the status of an accusative of the verb because it is an adverbial qualifier meaning fawqa qamīsihi they slaughtered a lamb and dabbed it his shirt with its blood — but they forgot to tear it the shirt — and they said that it was his blood. He Jacob said when he saw that it the shirt was undamaged and realised that they were lying ‘Nay but your souls have beguiled you into something and so you did it to him. Yet comely patience! without any anxiety! fa-sabrun jamīlun is the predicate of a missing subject such as amrī ‘my course’. And God is the One Whose succour is sought in that predicament which you describe’ that which you mention of Joseph’s affair.
Joseph,12,19,"And there came a caravan, and they sent their waterdrawer. He let down his pail (into the pit). He said: Good luck! Here is a youth. And they hid him as a treasure, and Allah was Aware of what they did.",And there came a caravan — travellers going from Midian to Egypt who stopped near to Joseph’s well — and they sent their water-drawer the one who goes down to the water source to draw from it and he let down his bucket into the well and Joseph clung to it and he pulled him out and when he saw him he said ‘Good news!’ a variant reading of yā bushrā has yā bushrāya this vocative call is figurative in other words it is to be understood as ‘Come O good news now is your time!’ ‘This is a young boy’. His brothers became aware of this and came to him and they hid him that is they disguised his real status claiming that he was as a piece of merchandise by saying ‘This is a slave of ours he is a runaway’; but Joseph did not say anything fearing that they might kill him. But God knew well what they were doing.
Joseph,12,20,"And they sold him for a low price, a number of silver coins; and they attached no value to him.",Then they sold him — they the caravan purchased him from them — for a very low a diminished price a handful of dirhams 20 or 22; for they that is his brothers set small store by him. So the caravan brought him to Egypt where the one who had bought him sold him for 20 dinars two pairs of sandals and two robes.
Joseph,12,21,"And he of Egypt who purchased him said unto his wife: Receive him honourably. Perchance he may prove useful to us or we may adopt him as a son. Thus we established Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation of events. And Allah was predominant in His career, but most of mankind know not.",And he of Egypt who purchased him Potifar the Court Officer Qitfīr al-‘azīz said to his wife Zulaikha Zulaykhā ‘Give him an honourable place an honourable residence with us. Maybe he will be useful to us or we may adopt him as a son’ — for he was chaste. Thus just as We delivered him from being killed and from the well and softened the Court Officer’s heart for him We established Joseph in the land the land of Egypt until he attained what status he attained that We might teach him the interpretation of events the interpretation of visions wa-li-nu‘allimahu min ta’wīli’l-ahādīth is a supplement to an implied missing part connected to makkannā ‘We established’ in other words an implied li-numallikahu ‘so that We might give him kingship’; or else the wāw of wa-li-nu‘allimahu ‘that We might teach him’ is to be understood as being extra. God’s way always prevails exalted be He nothing being beyond Him but most people — and they are the disbelievers — do not know this.
Joseph,12,22,And And when he reached his prime We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus We reward the good.,And when he reached his prime — which was at 30 or 33 years of age — We gave him power of judgement wisdom and knowledge understanding in matters of religion before his call to prophethood. Thus just as We rewarded him We reward those who are virtuous to the good of their souls.
Joseph,12,23,"And she, in whose house he was, asked of him an evil act. She bolted the doors and said: Come! He said: I seek refuge in Allah! Lo! he is my lord, who hath treated me honourably. Lo! wrong-doers never prosper.",And she in whose house he was — namely Zulaykhā — attempted to seduce him that is she asked him to lie with her and she closed the doors of the house. And she said to him ‘Come!’ hayta laka the lām of laka is for clarification; a variant reading has hīta laka or haytu laka. ‘God forbid!’ I seek refuge with God from this he said. ‘Truly he who bought me is my lord my master who has given me an honourable place an honourable residence and so I cannot betray him with regard to his family. Truly evildoers fornicators never prosper’.
Joseph,12,24,"She verily desired him, and he would have desired her if it had not been that he saw the argument of his Lord. Thus it was, that We might ward off from him evil and lewdness. Lo! he was of Our chosen slaves.",And she certainly desired him she sought sexual intercourse with him and he would have desired her too he would have sought the same had it not been that he saw the proof of his Lord Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘Jacob was made to appear before him and he struck his Joseph’s breast whereupon his sexual desire withdrew from his body through his fingernails the response to lawlā ‘had it not been’ has been omitted understood to be la-jāma‘ahā ‘he would have lain with her’. So it was that We made him see the proof that We might ward off from him evil betrayal and lewdness the act of fornication. Truly he was of Our devoted servants in terms of obedience mukhlisīn a variant reading has mukhlasīn in other words ‘chosen/purified servants’.
Joseph,12,25,"And they raced with one another to the door, and she tore his shirt from behind, and they met her lord and master at the door. She said: What shall be his reward, who wisheth evil to thy folk, save prison or a painful doom ?",And they raced to the door Joseph making for it in order to escape while she in order to grab hold of him caught hold of his garment and pulled him towards her and she tore his shirt from behind whereupon they encountered her master her husband at the door. She composed herself and then said ‘What is to be the requital of him who intends evil who intends fornication against your folk but that he should be imprisoned locked up in a jail or suffer a painful chastisement?’ by having him beaten.
Joseph,12,26,"(Joseph) said: She it was who asked of me an evil act. And a witness of her own folk testified: If his shirt is torn from before, then she speaketh truth and he is of the liars.",He Joseph said declaring himself innocent of the charge ‘It was she who attempted to seduce me’. And a witness of her own folk testified her paternal cousin — it is reported that he was still a child in the cradle — and he said ‘If his shirt has been torn from the front then she speaks the truth and he is of the liars;
Joseph,12,27,"And if his shirt is torn from behind, then she hath lied and he is of the truthful.",but if his shirt has been torn from behind then she has lied and he is of the truthful’.
Joseph,12,28,"So when he saw his shirt torn from behind, he said: Lo! this is of the guile of you women. Lo! the guile of you is very great.",So when he her husband saw that his shirt was torn from behind he said ‘Indeed this — that is your saying ‘What is to be the requital of him who intends …’ to the end of the verse Q. 1225 — is of the guile of you O women. Verily your guile is great.
Joseph,12,29,"O Joseph! Turn away from this, and thou, (O woman), ask forgiveness for thy sin. Lo! thou art of the faulty.",Then he said O Joseph ignore this matter and do not mention it to anyone lest it be broadcast; and you O Zulaykhā ask forgiveness for your sin surely you have been of the erring’ the sinful; but the tale was reported and became public.
Joseph,12,30,And women in the city said: The ruler’s wife is asking of her slave-boy an ill-deed. Indeed he has smitten her to the heart with love. We behold her in plain aberration.,And some of the women in the city the city of Egypt said ‘The Court Officer’s wife has been seducing her boy her servant. Indeed he has smitten her heart with love hubban is for specification in other words ‘her love of him has entered her heart’s pericardium shaghāfa qalbihā that is its inner casing. Lo! we see her to be in plain aberration’ that is in error evident in her love of him.
Joseph,12,31,"And when she heard of their sly talk, she sent to them and prepared for them a cushioned couch (to lie on at the feast) and gave to every one of them a knife and said (to Joseph): Come out unto them! And when they saw him they exalted him and cut their hands, exclaiming: Allah Blameless! This is no a human being. This is not other than some gracious angel.",And when she heard of their machinations their backbiting of her she sent for them and prepared for them a repast muttaka’ is food that requires cutting with a knife since one leans upon it ittikā’ this repast was utruj ‘citron’. She then gave each one of them a knife and said to Joseph ‘Come out before them!’ And when they saw him they were in awe of they exalted him and cut their hands with the knives without feeling any pain because their hearts were so engrossed by Joseph and they exclaimed ‘God preserve us! — in exaltation of him — This namely Joseph is no human being this is but a noble angel!’ on account of his all-encompassing beauty which is a characteristic not usually found among humankind. In the Sahīh of al-Bukhārī it is reported that one half of all beauty was given to him.
Joseph,12,32,"She said: This is he on whose account ye blamed me. I asked of him an evil act, but he proved continent, but if he do not my behest he verily shall be imprisoned, and verily shall be of those brought low.",She the wife of the Court Officer said when she saw what happened to them ‘This is he on whose account for the love of whom you blamed me alladhī lumtunnanī fīhi is an explication of her excuse. Indeed I did attempt to seduce him but he withheld himself he refused. Yet if he does not do what I bid him he verily shall be imprisoned and verily shall be of those brought low’ those abased. The women said to him ‘Obey your mistress!’.
Joseph,12,33,"He said: O my Lord! Prison is more dear than that unto which they urge me, and if Thou fend not off their wiles from me I shall incline unto them and become of the foolish.",He said ‘My Lord prison is dearer to me than that to which they are urging me. And if You do not fend off their wiles from me then I shall tend I shall incline towards them and become of the ignorant the sinful this is intended as a supplication which is why God exalted be He then says
Joseph,12,34,"So his Lord heard his prayer and fended off their wiles from him. Lo! He is Hearer, Knower.",So his Lord answered him his supplication and He fended off their wiles from him. Truly He is the Hearer of words the Knower of deeds.
Joseph,12,35,And it seemed good to them (the men-folk) after they had seen the signs (of his innocence) to imprison him for a time.,Then it seemed it appeared good to them after they had seen the signs indicating Joseph’s innocence that they should imprison him for a while until such time as people ceased to talk of him. He was thus imprisoned.
Joseph,12,36,"And two young men went to prison with him. One of them said: I dreamed that I was pressing wine. The other said: I dreamed that I was carrying upon my head bread whereof the birds were eating. Announce unto us the interpretation, for we see thee of those good (at interpretation).",And there entered the prison with him two youths two young men servants of the king one of whom was his cup-bearer the other his food-taster. They noticed that he interpreted dreams and so they said ‘Let us try him’. One of them the cup-bearer said ‘I dreamed that I was pressing wine’ that is grapes. The other the food-taster said ‘I dreamed that I was carrying on my head bread whereof the birds were eating. Tell us inform us of its interpretation for indeed we see you as being among the virtuous’.
Joseph,12,37,He said: The food which ye are given (daily) shall not come unto you but I shall tell you the interpretation ere it cometh unto you. This is of that which my Lord hath taught me. Lo! I have forsaken the religion of folk who believe not in Allah and are disbelievers in the Hereafter.,He said to them both in order to inform them that he knew how to interpret dreams ‘The food with which you are provided shall not come to you while you are asleep but I shall tell you the interpretation thereof while you are conscious before it the interpretation thereof comes to you. This is from that which my Lord has taught me — herein is an incitement for them to believe which he reinforces with the following words Lo! I have forsaken the creed the religion of a folk who do not believe in God and who moreover hum ‘they’ is repeated for emphasis are disbelievers in the Hereafter.
Joseph,12,38,"And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It never was for us to attribute aught as partner to Allah. This is of the bounty of Allah unto us (the seed of Abraham) and unto mankind; but most men give not thanks.",And I follow the creed of my fathers Abraham and Isaac and Jacob. It never was right for us to associate anything min shay’in min is extra with God — on account of our God-given immunity from error. That affirmation of God’s Oneness is from God’s bounty to us and to mankind; but most people — and these are the disbelievers — do not give thanks to God and so they associate others with Him.
Joseph,12,39,"O my fellow-prisoners! Are divers lords better, or Allah the One, Almighty ?",He Joseph then explicitly calls them to faith saying O my two fellow-prisoners! inmates of the prison Are several lords better or is God the One the Almighty better? an interrogative meant as an affirmative.
Joseph,12,40,"Those whom ye worship beside Him are but names which ye have named, ye and your fathers. Allah hath revealed no sanction for them. The decision rests with Allah only, Who hath commanded you that ye worship none save Him. This is the right religion, but most men know not.",You do not worship apart from Him that is other than Him anything but mere names that you have named that you have named for idols you and your fathers. God has not revealed any warrant any definitive argument or proof regarding them regarding worship of them. Judgement decree belongs only to God alone. He has commanded that you worship none but Him. That affirmation of God’s Oneness is the upright the straight religion but most people — and these are the disbelievers — do not know the punishment in which they shall end up and so they ascribe partners to God.
Joseph,12,41,"O my two fellow-prisoners! As for one of you, he will pour out wine for his lord to drink; and as for the other, he will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head. Thus is the case judged concerning which ye did inquire.",O fellow-prisoners! As for one of you that is the cup-bearer he will depart after three days and he shall serve his lord his master wine to drink as usual; and as for the other he will depart after three days and he will be crucified so that the birds will eat from his head this is the interpretation of both your dreams. They said ‘We never dreamed a thing!’; he said decided concluded is the matter regarding which you sought opinion’ about which you enquired whether you spoke truthfully or were lying.
Joseph,12,42,"And he said unto him of the twain who he knew would be released: Mention me in the presence of thy lord. But Satan caused him to forget to mention it to his lord, so he (Joseph) stayed in prison for some years.",Then he said to the one whom he deemed whom he was certain would be saved of the two — and this was the cup-bearer ‘Mention me to your lord’ your master and say to him ‘There is a young man in jail who has been wrongly imprisoned’. So he the cup-bearer departed but Satan caused him that is the cup-bearer to forget the mention of Joseph before his master so that he Joseph stayed he remained in prison for some years it is said that he remained for seven years or for twelve.
Joseph,12,43,"And the king said: Lo! I saw in a dream seven fat kine which seven lean were eating, and seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry. O notables! Expound for me my vision, if ye can interpret dreams.",And the king the king of Egypt — al-Rayyān b. al-Walīd — said ‘I saw in a dream seven fat kine being devoured being swallowed up by seven lean ones of kine ‘ijāf is the plural of ‘ajfā’ and seven green ears of corn and others that is seven other ears of corn dry that had wound themselves around the green ones and risen above them. O courtiers! Give me your opinion about my vision expound for me its interpretation if you can interpret visions’ then interpret it for me.
Joseph,12,44,They answered: Jumbled dreams! And we are not knowing in the interpretation of dreams.,They said this is ‘A jumble a mixture of dreams! And we are not knowledgeable in the interpretation of dreams’.
Joseph,12,45,"And he of the two who was released, and (now) at length remembered, said: I am going to announce unto you the interpretation, therefore send me forth.",And he of the two who was released that is of the two young men namely the cup-bearer remembering iddakara the original tā’ of tadhakkara has been changed to a dāl and assimilated with the dhāl after a time after a period of time the predicament of Joseph said ‘I will inform you of its interpretation; so send me forth’ so they sent him forth and he came to Joseph and said
Joseph,12,46,"(And when he came to Joseph in the prison, he exclaimed): Joseph! O thou truthful one! Expound for us the seven fat kine which seven lean were eating and the seven green ears of corn and other (seven) dry, that I may return unto the people, so that they may know.",‘O Joseph O truthful one one given to truth give us your opinion concerning seven fat kine that are devoured by seven lean ones and concerning seven green ears of corn and seven others dry that I may return to the people that is to the king and his courtiers so that they might know’ its interpretation.
Joseph,12,47,"He said: Ye shall sow seven years as usual, but that which ye reap, leave it in the ear, all save a little which ye eat.",He said ‘You shall sow — that is go ahead and sow — seven years consecutively — and this was the interpretation of the seven fat ones — but that which you reap leave it in the ear lest it spoil except for a little which you eat thresh it.
Joseph,12,48,"Then after that will come seven hard years which will devour all that ye have prepared for them, save a little of that which ye have stored.",Then after that in other words after the seven fertile years there shall come seven hard barren and unyielding years — the interpretation of the seven lean ones — which shall devour what you set aside for them of grain sown during the fertile years in other words you shall eat all this during these seven hard years all except a little which you have preserved stored.
Joseph,12,49,"Then, after that, will come a year when the people will have plenteous crops and when they will press (wine and oil).",Then after that in other words after the seven barren years there shall come a year in which the people will be granted relief through rain and in which they will press fruit grapes and other seeds because of its that year’s fertility.
Joseph,12,50,"And the king said: Bring him unto me. And when the messenger came unto him, he (Joseph) said: Return unto thy lord and ask him what was the case of the women who cut their hands. Lo! my Lord knoweth their guile.",And the king after the messenger had come to him and informed him of its the dream’s interpretation said ‘Bring him to me!’ that is the one who interpreted it. And when the messenger came to him that is to Joseph and summoned him in order to depart from the prison he said — with the intention of manifesting his innocence — ‘Return to your lord and ask him to inquire “What of what was the case with the women who cut their hands?” Surely my lord my master has knowledge of their guile’; he the messenger thus returned and informed the king who then summoned them the women.
Joseph,12,51,"He (the king) (then sent for those women and) said: What happened when ye asked an evil act of Joseph ? They answered: Allah Blameless! We know no evil of him. Said the wife of the ruler: Now the truth is out. I asked of him an evil act, and he is surely of the truthful.",He said ‘What was your business women when you solicited Joseph?’ did you find on his part any inclination towards you? ‘God preserve us!’ they said. ‘We know of no evil in him.’ The Court Officer’s wife said ‘Now the truth is out now it has become clear; it was I who attempted to seduce him and he is indeed of the truthful’ in his saying It was she who attempted to seduce me Q. 1226. Joseph was then informed of this and he said
Joseph,12,52,"(Then Joseph said: I asked for) this, that he (my lord) may know that I betrayed him not in secret, and that surely Allah guideth not the snare of the betrayers.",‘That plea of innocence is so that he the Court officer may know I did not betray him with regard to his family in his absence bi’l-ghayb is a circumstantial qualifier and that truly God does not guide to success the guile of the treacherous; he Joseph then humbled himself before God and said
Joseph,12,53,"I do not exculpate myself. Lo! the (human) soul enjoineth unto evil, save that whereon my Lord hath mercy. Lo! my Lord is Forgiving, Merciful.",Yet I do not exculpate my own soul of slipping into error; verily the soul as such is ever inciting to evil except that whereon meaning the person upon whom my Lord has mercy and so protects from sin. Truly my Lord is Forgiving Merciful’.
Joseph,12,54,And the king said: Bring him unto me that I may attach him to my person. And when he had talked with him he said: Lo! thou art to-day in our presence established and trusted.,And the king said ‘Bring him to me that I may use him for myself’ that I may make him mine exclusively with none to share him with me. The messenger came to him to Joseph and said ‘Respond to the king!’ and so he got up and bid farewell to his fellow-prisoners and prayed for them. He then washed himself put on some good clothes and entered upon him. And when he had spoken with him he said to him ‘Indeed you are on this day in our presence established and trustworthy’ a person of status entrusted over our affair so what do you think we should do? He said ‘Gather food stocks and sow abundantly in these fertile years then store the corn in its ears. People from far and wide will come to you and ask you to supply them with provisions’. He the king said ‘Whom can I delegate this task to?’
Joseph,12,55,He said: Set me over the storehouses of the land. Lo! I am a skilled custodian.,He Joseph said ‘Place me in charge of the storehouses of the land the land of Egypt. I am indeed a skilled custodian’ one worthy of custodianship thereof and knowledgeable in such affairs — it is also said that he meant I am indeed a competent scribe and accountant.
Joseph,12,56,Thus gave We power to Joseph in the land. He was the owner of it where he pleased. We reach with Our mercy whom We will. We lose not the reward of the good.,Thus in the same way that We were graceful towards Him by delivering him from prison We established Joseph in the land the land of Egypt that he may settle in it wherever he wished after having suffered hardship and imprisonment. According to the story the king crowned him gave him a signet-ring to wear and appointed him in place of the Court officer whom he removed from his position and who later died; and so he the king made him Joseph take the latter’s spouse as a wife. He Joseph discovered that she was still a virgin and she bore him two children. He Joseph established justice in Egypt and people became subject to him. We confer Our mercy on whomever We will and We do not waste the wage of the virtuous.
Joseph,12,57,"And the reward of the Hereafter is better, for those who believe and ward off (evil).",Yet the wage of the Hereafter is better than the wage of this world for those who believe and are God-fearing. And so the years of drought arrived and afflicted the land of Canaan and Syria.
Joseph,12,58,"And Joseph’s brethren came and presented themselves before him, and he knew them but they knew him not.",And Joseph’s brothers came — except for Benjamin — in order to secure provisions when they found out that the new Court officer of Egypt was providing food at its fair price; and they entered to him and he recognised them to be his brothers but they did not recognise him not knowing who he was because it had been a long time since they had seen him and because they supposed that he had died. They spoke to him in Hebrew and he said to them as if reproaching them ‘What brings you to my land?’ They replied ‘We have come for supplies’. He said ‘You might be spies!’ They said ‘God forbid!’ He said ‘So where are you from?’ They said ‘From the land of Canaan our father is Jacob the prophet of God.’ He said ‘Does he have children other than you?’ They said ‘Yes. We used to be twelve but the youngest of us passed away he perished in the wild. He was the most beloved to him our father from among us; only his full brother remains and so he keeps him by his side in order to comfort himself with him in place of the other.’ He Joseph commanded that they be given lodging and treated well.
Joseph,12,59,And when he provided them with their provision he said: Bring unto me a brother of yours from your father. See ye not that I fill up the measure and I am the best of hosts ?,And when he had equipped them with their provision when he had given them the full measure of food he said ‘Bring me a brother of yours from your father namely Benjamin that I might know that you have been truthful in what you said. Do you not see that I give the full measure that I complete it without any fraud and that I am the best of hosts?
Joseph,12,60,"And if ye bring him not unto me, then there shall be no measure for you with me, nor shall ye draw near.",But if you do not bring him to me there will be no measure that is no provisions for you with me; and do not come near me’ wa-lā taqrabūn is either a prohibition or a supplement to the syntactical locus of fa-lā kayla in other words ‘and you shall be denied the measure and will not be allowed to come near me’.
Joseph,12,61,They said: We will try to win him from his father: that we will surely do.,They said ‘We will try to tempt his father away from him that is we will try our hardest to seek him from him. That we will surely do’.
Joseph,12,62,"He said unto his young men: Place their merchandise in their saddlebags, so that they may know it when they go back to their folk, and so will come again.",And he said to his young men li-fityatihi a variant reading has li-fityānihi ‘his servants’ ‘Place their merchandise that money with which they bought the supplies and these were a few dirhams in their saddlebags their supply sacks so that they may recognise it when they return to their folk and empty their sacks and so come back’ to us deeming it unlawful to retain these monies.
Joseph,12,63,"So when they went back to their father they said: O our father! The measure is denied us, so send with us our brother that we may obtain the measure, surely we will guard him well.",So when they went back to their father they said ‘O father the measure will be denied us unless you send forth our brother to him to the Court officer; so send forth our brother with us that we may obtain the measure read naktal or yaktal ‘that he may obtain the measure for us’. Surely we will guard him well’.
Joseph,12,64,"He said: Can I entrust him to you save as I entrusted his brother to you aforetime ? Allah is better at guarding, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.",He said ‘Should I — I will only — trust you with him like I trusted you with his brother Joseph before? despite the fact that you have done to him what you have done? Yet God is best at guarding hifzan a variant reading has hāfizan ‘a guardian’ as a specification similar to when they say li’Llāhi darruhu fārisan ‘By God how excellent a horseman he is!’; and He is the Most Merciful of merciful ones’ and so I hope that He will show favour to me by guarding him.
Joseph,12,65,"And when they opened their belongings they discovered that their merchandise had been returned to them. They said: O our father! What (more) can we ask ? Here is our merchandise returned to us. We shall get provision for our folk and guard our brother, and we shall have the extra measure of a camel (load). This (that we bring now) is a light measure.",And when they opened their belongings they found that their merchandise had been restored to them. They said ‘O father what more should we desire? mā nabghī mā is interrogative that is to say what greater thing than this can we ask for from the king’s generosity?’; a variant reading has mā tabghī ‘what more do you desire?’ as an address to Jacob — for they had mentioned to him his the king’s generosity towards them. Here is our merchandise restored to us. And we shall get provisions for our family we shall obtain supplies for them namely food and guard our brother and we shall receive an extra camel’s load because of our brother; that will be an easy measure’ for the king to grant us given his munificence.
Joseph,12,66,"He said: I will not send him with you till ye give me an undertaking in the name of Allah that ye will bring him back to me, unless ye are surrounded. And when they gave him their undertaking he said: Allah is the Warden over what we say.",He said ‘I will not send him with you until you give me a solemn pledge a covenant in the name of God by your swearing an oath that assuredly you will bring him back to me unless you are besieged’ such that you die or are overwhelmed and thus unable to bring him back. They agreed to this. And when they gave him their solemn pledge to this effect he said ‘God shall be Guardian Witness over what we say’ we and you. Thus he sent him with them.
Joseph,12,67,"And he said: O my sons! Go not in by one gate; go in by different gates. I can naught avail you as against Allah. Lo! the decision rests with Allah only. In Him do I put my trust, and in Him let all the trusting put their trust.",And he said ‘O my sons do not enter Egypt by one gate but enter by separate gates lest the evil eye smite you. Yet I cannot avail protect you by this that I have said against God min Allāhi min is extra anything which He might have decreed against you; this that I have said is only out of affection for you. Judgement belongs to God alone. On Him I rely in Him I trust and on Him let all the trusting rely’.
Joseph,12,68,"And when they entered in the manner which their father had enjoined, it would have naught availed them as against Allah; it was but a need of Jacob’s soul which he thus satisfied; and lo! he was a lord of knowledge because We had taught him; but most of mankind know not.",God exalted be He says And when they entered in the manner which their father had bidden them that is separately it did not avail them anything min shay’in min is extra against God that is against His decree; it was but a need in Jacob’s soul which he thus satisfied and this need was his desire to fend off the evil eye from them out of affection for them. And verily he was possessed of knowledge because We had taught him; but most of mankind — and they are the disbelievers — do not know about God’s inspiring His elect.
Joseph,12,69,"And when they went in before Joseph, he took his brother unto him, saying: Lo! I, even I, am thy brother, therefore sorrow not for what they did.",And when they entered to Joseph he took his brother into his arms saying to him ‘Truly it is me your brother therefore do not despair do not be grieved at what they did’ in the way of envying us. He commanded him not to tell them anything and he Joseph agreed with him that he would devise a trick to keep him Benjamin with him.
Joseph,12,70,"And when he provided them with their provision, he put the drinking-cup in his brother’s saddlebag, and then a crier cried: O camel- riders! Lo! ye are surely thieves!",And when he had equipped them with their provision he put the drinking-cup a golden cup studded with jewels into the saddlebag of his brother Benjamin. Then a crier shouted a herald cried after they were dismissed from Joseph’s court ‘O cameleers caravan you are surely thieves!’
Joseph,12,71,"They cried, coming toward them: What is it ye have lost ?",They said after coming towards them ‘What is it that you are missing?’
Joseph,12,72,"They said: We have lost the king’s cup, and he who bringeth it shall have a camel-load, and I (said Joseph) am answerable for it.",They said ‘We are missing the king’s goblet his cup. And he who brings it shall have a camel’s load of food supplies and I will guarantee that’ the camel’s load.
Joseph,12,73,"They said: By Allah, well ye know we came not to do evil in the land, and are no thieves.",They said ‘By God’ ta’Llāhi is an oath entailing astonishment ‘You know very well that we did not come to work corruption in the land and we are certainly not thieves’ that is we have never stolen anything.
Joseph,12,74,"They said: And what shall be the penalty for it, if ye prove liars ?",They the crier and his men said ‘So what shall be his requital that is the thief’s if you prove to have been liars?’ when you said ‘we are certainly not thieves’ and if it is found among your belongings?
Joseph,12,75,"They said: The penalty for it! He in whose bag (the cup) is found, he is the penalty for it. Thus we requite wrong-doers.",They said ‘His requital qālū jazā’uhu the subject the predicate of which is the following man wujida fī rahlihi shall be the requital of him in whose saddlebag it is found that he be enslaved — this is then reiterated by His words He the thief shall be the requital for it that is for the stolen item and nothing else this was the customary practice of the family of Jacob. Thus with such a requital do we requite those who do evil’ through theft. They thus permitted Joseph to have their saddlebags searched.
Joseph,12,76,"Then he (Joseph) began the search with their bags before his brother’s bag, then he produced it from his brother’s bag. Thus did We contrive for Joseph. He could not have taken his brother according to the king’s law unless Allah willed. We raise by grades (of mercy) whom We will, and over every lord of knowledge there is one more knowing.",And so he began with their sacks and searched them before his brother’s sack lest he be accused of the theft; then he pulled it the drinking-cup out of his brother’s sack. God exalted be He says Thus through such contrivance did We contrive for Joseph thus We taught him how to devise a plot to take his brother; he Joseph could not have taken his brother as a slave on account of theft according to the king’s law according to the laws of the king of Egypt — since his a thief’s requital according to his law would have been a beating and a penalty of twice the value of the stolen item but not enslavement — unless God willed for him to be taken according to the law of his father Jacob; in other words he was only able to take him with God’s will by God’s inspiring him to ask his brothers about the nature of requital and their responding according to what is decreed by their customary practice. We raise by degrees whom We will read with a genitive annexation darajāti man nashā’ or simply with nunation darajātin man nashā’ in terms of knowledge as We did with Joseph; and above every man of knowledge from among creatures is one who knows better better than him and so on until it ends with God exalted be He.
Joseph,12,77,"They said: If he stealeth, a brother of his stole before. But Joseph kept it secret in his soul and revealed it not unto them. He said (within himself): Ye are in worse case, and Allah knoweth best (the truth of) that which ye allege.",They said ‘If he is stealing a brother of his stole before’ that is Joseph — he had stolen a golden idol from his maternal grandfather and smashed it lest he worship it. But Joseph kept it secret in his soul and did not disclose it manifest it to them the suffixed pronoun in yubdi-hā ‘disclose it’ refers to the words in his following saying; he said within himself ‘You are a worse case than Joseph and his brother because of your stealing a brother of yours from your father and your wronging him. And God knows very well what you are describing’ what you are mentioning with regard to him.
Joseph,12,78,"They said: O ruler of the land! Lo! he hath a very aged father, so take one of us instead of him. Lo! we behold thee of those who do kindness.",They said ‘O Court officer lo! he has a father an aged man who loves him more than we do and who finds solace in him from the anguish he feels for his dead son; and it will grieve him to part with him so take one of us enslave him in his place instead of him indeed we see that you are among the virtuous’ in terms of your actions.
Joseph,12,79,He said: Allah forbid that we should seize save him with whom we found our property; then truly we should be wrong-doers.,He said ‘God forbid ma‘ādha’Llāhi lit. ‘refuge is with God’ is in the accusative because it is a verbal noun the verb having been omitted and placed in a genitive annexation with its direct object in other words understand it as na‘ūdhu bi’Llāhi ‘we seek refuge with God’ that we should take anyone save him with whom we found our property — he did not say ‘save him who stole our property’ being careful not to lie; for then truly — if we were to take anyone other than him — we would be evildoers’.
Joseph,12,80,"So, When they despaired of (moving) him, they conferred together apart. The eldest of them said: Know ye not how your father took an undertaking from you in Allah’s name and how ye failed in the case of Joseph aforetime ? Therefore I shall not go forth from the land until my father giveth leave or Allah judgeth for me. He is the Best of Judges.",So when they despaired of moving him they withdrew to confer privately together najiyyan is a verbal noun that can be used to refer to one person or more in other words understand it as meaning yunājī ba‘duhum ba‘dan ‘one conferring with the other’. The most senior of them in years — Reuben — or the most senior of them in opinion — Judah said ‘Are you not aware that your father has taken a solemn pledge a covenant from you by God concerning your brother and formerly wa-min qablu mā the mā is extra you failed regarding Joseph? but it the mā is also said to be relating to the verbal action in other words it is a subject the predicate of which is min qabl ‘formerly’. So I will never leave part with this land the land of Egypt until my father permits me to return to him or God judges for me through the deliverance of my brother; and He is the best the fairest of judges.
Joseph,12,81,Return unto your father and say: O our father! Lo! thy son hath stolen. We testify only to that which we know; we are not guardians of the Unseen.,Go back to your father and say “O our father your son has indeed stolen and we testified against him only regarding what we knew from the certainty of having seen the king’s cup in his saddlebag; we could not have guarded against the Unseen that which was hidden from us when we gave our pledge had we known that he would steal we would not have taken him with us to Egypt.
Joseph,12,82,"Ask the township where we were, and the caravan with which we travelled hither. Lo! we speak the truth.",And ask the city in which we were — namely Egypt — in other words send forth someone to ask its people and the caravan the men of the caravan with which we approached — and these were a group of Canaanites. Surely we speak the truth” ’ in what we say. So they went back to him and told him as much.
Joseph,12,83,"(And when they came unto their father and had spoken thus to him) he said: Nay, but your minds have beguiled you into something. (My course is) comely patience! It may be that Allah will bring them all unto me. Lo! He, only He, is the Knower, the Wise.",‘Nay’ he said ‘but your souls have beguiled you into have adorned for you something and you did it he accused them because of what had happened with them before concerning Joseph. Yet comely patience will be my course of patience! It may be that God will bring them Joseph and his two brothers all back to me. Indeed He is the Knower of my predicament the Wise’ in His actions.
Joseph,12,84,"And he turned away from them and said: Alas, my grief for Joseph! And his eyes were whitened with the sorrow that he was suppressing.",And he turned away from them no longer addressing them and said ‘Alas my grief for Joseph!’ yā asafā the final alif of asafā has taken the place of the possessive yā’ of genitive annexation sc. yā asafī in other words it means yā huznī ‘O my sorrow’. And his eyes turned white their dark colour was effaced and became white on account of his tears with grief for him such that he was filled with suppressed agony anguished and grief-stricken but not manifesting his grief.
Joseph,12,85,"They said: By Allah, thou wilt never cease remembering Joseph till thy health is ruined or thou art of those who perish!",They said ‘By God you will never cease remembering Joseph until you are consumed on the verge of perishing on account of your illness it haradan ‘consumed’ is a verbal noun equally applicable to one person or more or you are of those who perish’ of the dead.
Joseph,12,86,"He said: I expose my distress and anguish only unto Allah, and I know from Allah that which ye know not.",He said to them ‘I complain of my anguish — bathth is severe grief which cannot be endured unless it is proclaimed yubaththu to others — and grief only to God not to any other than Him for it is worth complaining to Him; and I know from God what you do not know and that is that Joseph’s dream is true and that he is alive. Then he said
Joseph,12,87,"Go, O my sons, and ascertain concerning Joseph and his brother, and despair not of the Spirit of Allah. Lo! none despaireth of the Spirit of Allah save disbelieving folk.",O my sons go and enquire about Joseph and his brother seek news of them and do not despair of God’s gracious Spirit His mercy. Indeed none despairs of the gracious Spirit of God save the disbelieving folk’ and so they departed to Egypt to look for Joseph.
Joseph,12,88,"And when they came (again) before him (Joseph) they said: O ruler! Misfortune hath touched us and our folk, and we bring but poor merchandise, so fill for us the measure and be charitable unto us. Lo! Allah will requite the charitable,",And so when they entered to him they said ‘O Court officer misfortune hunger has befallen us and our family; and we have come with reject merchandise refused by any person who sees it because of its worthlessness — it consisted of counterfeit dirhams or something else — so fill up complete for us the measure and be charitable to us by overlooking the worthlessness of our merchandise; truly God requites the charitable’ He rewards them he Joseph thus took pity on them and he was overtaken by compassion for them and removed the partition between them and himself.
Joseph,12,89,He said: Know ye what ye did unto Joseph and his brother in your ignorance ?,Then he said to them in rebuke ‘Do you realise what you did to Joseph in the way of beating him and selling him and otherwise and his brother oppressing him after having separated him from his brother while you were ignorant?’ of where the affair of Joseph will lead?
Joseph,12,90,They said: Is it indeed thou who art Joseph ? He said: I am Joseph and this is my brother. Allah hath shown us favour. Lo! he who wardeth off (evil) and endureth (findeth favour); for lo! Allah loseth not the wages of the kindly.,They said — after recognising him by his noble traits — cautiously inquiring ‘Is it really read a-innaka either pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second but in both cases inserting an alif you Joseph?’. He said ‘I am indeed Joseph and this is my brother. God has truly shown favour He has been gracious to us by bringing us together. Verily if one fears if one fears God and endures what happens to him God does not waste the wage of those who are virtuous’ in this respect the overt noun al-muhsinīn ‘the virtuous’ has replaced the third person pronominalisation.
Joseph,12,91,"They said: By Allah, verily Allah hath preferred thee above us, and we were indeed sinful.",They said ‘By God truly God has preferred you over us with kingship and in other ways and indeed we wa-in in is softened in other words it is understood as innā ‘indeed we’ have been erring’ sinful towards you and treated you disgracefully.
Joseph,12,92,"He said: Have no fear this day! May Allah forgive you, and He is the Most Merciful of those who show mercy.",He said ‘There shall be no reproach no blame on you this day — he specifically mentions this day because it was the day when they expected to be reproached although any other day would have been more appropriate for them to be reproached on. God will forgive you and He is the Most Merciful of the merciful.

And so he said Go with this shirt of mine — and this was the shirt of Abraham the one he wore when he was thrown into the fire; he Joseph had it around his neck when he was at the bottom of the well. It the shirt had come from Paradise Gabriel commanded him Joseph to send it off to Jacob saying that the scent of Paradise lingers in it and whenever it is cast upon a sufferer it heals him — and lay it on my father’s face and he will recover his sight; and bring me all your folk’.
Joseph,12,94,"When the caravan departed their father had said: Truly I am conscious of the breath of Joseph, though ye call me dotard.",And as the caravan set forth leaving behind the palm fields of Egypt their father said to those of his sons and their children present ‘Truly I sense the scent of Joseph — which the east wind had brought to him with God’s permission across a distance of three or eight or more days’ journey; if only you did not think me doting’ if only you did not regard me as foolish you would believe me.
Joseph,12,95,"(Those around him) said: By Allah, lo! thou art in thine old aberration.",They said to him ‘By God you are certainly in your misguidance your error of old’ in your excessive adoration of him and your enduring hope of encountering him again despite the length of time that has passed.
Joseph,12,96,"Then, when the bearer of glad tidings came, he laid it on his face and he became a seer once more. He said: Said I not unto you that I know from Allah that which ye know not ?",Then when fa-lammā an an is extra the bearer of good tidings Judah came with the shirt — he had been the one who brought the blood-stained shirt and so now he wished to bring him joy after he had previously brought him grief — he laid it he cast the shirt on his face and he regained his sight.

He is the Forgiving the Merciful’ he Jacob put off this plea of forgiveness until the last hour before dawn in order to be closer to the likelihood of it being accepted or he put it off until the eve of Friday. They then departed for Egypt where Joseph and the senior courtiers came out to meet them.
Joseph,12,99,"And when they came in before Joseph, he took his parents unto him, and said: Come into Egypt safe, if Allah will!",And when they entered to Joseph in his tent he took his parents his father and his mother — or and his maternal aunt — into his arms and said to them ‘Enter into Egypt if God will in safety’ and they entered and Joseph sat down on his throne.
Joseph,12,100,"And he placed his parents on the dais and they fell down before him prostrate, and he said: O my father! This is the interpretation of my dream of old. My Lord hath made it true, and He hath shown me kindness, since He took me out of the prison and hath brought you from the desert after Satan had made strife between me and my brethren. Lo! my Lord is tender unto whom He will. He is the Knower, the Wise.",And he raised his parents he seated them next to him upon the throne and they fell down that is his parents and brothers prostrating before him — a prostration that was actually a bowing down not placing their foreheads down on the ground; this was their standard form of greeting at that time. Then he said ‘O father this is the interpretation of my vision of old. Indeed my Lord has made it true. And indeed He has been gracious to me since He brought me out of the prison — he did not say ‘out of the well’ in a show of magnanimity lest his brothers feel ashamed — and has brought you from the desert after Satan had incited ill feeling made trouble between me and my brethren. Truly my Lord is Subtle in bringing about what He will. Truly He is the Knower of His creatures the Wise in His actions. His father Jacob remained with him for 24 years or for 17 years. The duration of his separation from Joseph had been 18 or 40 or 80 years. When death approached him he charged Joseph to take him and bury him by his father Isaac and so he Joseph himself went and buried him there. He Joseph then returned to Egypt and remained alive for another 23 years.
Joseph,12,101,"O my Lord! Thou hast given me (something) of sovereignty and hast taught me (something) of the interpretation of events - Creator of the heavens and the earth! Thou art my Protecting Guardian in the world and the Hereafter. Make me to die muslim (unto Thee), and join me to the righteous.",When he was nearing his end realising that he would not remain alive forever he longed for the everlasting kingdom and said My Lord indeed You have given me something of sovereignty and You have taught me the interpretation of events the ability to explain dreams. Originator Creator of the heavens and the earth! You are my Protector Guardian of my best interests in this world and the Hereafter. Take me in death to You in submission to You and join me to the righteous’ from among my fathers. He lived after that for another week or more. He died at the age of 120 years. The Egyptians were very covetous with regard to his grave; eventually they placed him in a marble coffin and buried him at the top of the Nile so that both banks would be blessed by his body — Glory be to the One Whose Kingdom never ends.
Joseph,12,102,This is of the tidings of the Unseen which We inspire in thee (Muhammad). Thou wast not present with them when they fixed their plan and they were scheming.,That which is mentioned of the matter of Joseph is of the tidings the tales of the Unseen what has been hidden from you O Muhammad (s) which We reveal to you; for you were not with them with Joseph’s brothers when they agreed upon their plan to plot against him that is when they resolved upon it and schemed against him; in other words you were not present among them to know their story and so tell it to others knowledge of it has come to you through revelation.
Joseph,12,103,"And though thou try much, most men will not believe.",Yet most people that is the people of Mecca however eager you might be that they believe will not believe.
Joseph,12,104,Thou askest them no fee for it. It is naught else than a reminder unto the peoples.,Nor do you ask them any wage that you should take for it that is for the Qur’ān — it namely the Qur’ān is but a reminder an admonition to all the worlds.
Joseph,12,105,How many a portent is there in the heavens and the earth which they pass by with face averted!,And how many a sign indicating the Oneness of God is there in the heavens and the earth which they pass by which they witness but disregard! not reflecting upon it.
Joseph,12,106,And most of them believe not in Allah except that they attribute partners (unto Him).,And most of them do not believe in God such that they might affirm that He is the Creator and the Sustainer without ascribing partners to Him by worshipping idols; which is why when crying their ritual response to God they used to say ‘At Your service no partner have You save a partner that belongs to You; You possess him and all that he possesses’ meaning it when they said it.
Joseph,12,107,"Deem they themselves secure from the coming on them of a pall of Allah’s punishment, or the coming of the Hour suddenly while they are unaware ?",Do they deem themselves secure from the coming upon them of a pall a calamity enveloping them of God’s chastisement or the coming of the Hour upon them suddenly while they are unaware? of the time of its arrival beforehand?

I and whosoever followeth me - Glory be to Allah! - and I am not of the idolaters.,Say to them ‘This is my way — which He explains by saying I call to the religion of God being upon sure knowledge plain proof I and whoever follows me whoever believes in me man ittaba‘anī is a supplement to anā ‘I’ the subject predicated by what preceded sc. ‘being upon sure knowledge’. So Glory be to God! in affirmation of His being exalted high above having partners and I am not of the idolaters’ — this sentence is also subsumed by the explanation of his statement about ‘his way’.
Joseph,12,109,"We sent not before thee (any messengers) save men whom We inspired from among the folk of the townships - Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them ? And verily the abode of the Hereafter, for those who ward off (evil), is best. Have ye then no sense ? -",And We did not send before you any messengers save men inspired by revelation yūhā ilayhim a variant reading has nūhī ilayhim ‘to whom We revealed’ — and not angels — from among the people of the towns the principal towns since they are more knowledgeable and wiser than the people of the desert who are crude and ignorant. Have they the people of Mecca not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? that is how they ended up when they were destroyed for denying their messengers? And verily the abode of the Hereafter that is Paradise is better for those who are wary of God. Will they not understand? read a-fa-lā ya‘qilūn or a-fa-lā ta‘qilūn. ‘Will you not understand?’ this O people of Mecca and so have faith?

And Our wrath cannot be warded from the guilty.",Until hattā indicates the end result indicated by the previous statement wa-mā arsalnā min qablika illā rijālan And We did not send before you any messengers save men above Q. 12109 that is to whom Our support waned until when the messengers despaired and thought when the messengers were certain that they were denied read kudhdhibū to mean that they were denied to such an extent that they believed that there would not be any possible acceptance of faith thereafter; or read kudhibū to mean that the communities thought that their messengers had been lied to concerning the victory which they had been promised Our help came to them and whomever We willed We delivered read fa-nunajjī or fa-nunjī; or fa-nujjiya as past tense ‘whomever We wished was delivered’. And Our wrath Our chastisement cannot be averted from the sinning the idolatrous folk.
Joseph,12,111,"In their history verily there is a lesson for men of understanding. It is no invented story but a confirmation of the existing (Scripture) and a detailed explanation of everything, and a guidance and a mercy for folk who believe.",Verily there is in their stories that is the messengers’ stories a lesson for people of pith possessors of intellect. It this Qur’ān is not a fabricated an invented discourse but it is a confirmation of what was revealed before it of scriptures and a detailing an elucidation of everything that one needs for the proper observance of religion and a guidance from error and a mercy for a folk who believe such folk are singled out for mention because they are the ones to benefit from it to the exclusion of others.

He directs the command He conducts the affairs of His Kingdom. He details He expounds the signs the indications of His power so that you O people of Mecca might be certain of the encounter with your Lord through resurrection.
The Thunder,13,3,"And He it is Who spread out the earth and placed therein firm hills and flowing streams, and of all fruits He placed therein two spouses (male and female).

Thou art a warner only, and for every folk a guide.",And those who disbelieve say ‘Why has not some sign been sent down upon him upon Muhammad (s) from his Lord!’ the like of the staff and the glowing hand or the she-camel.

The prayer of disbelievers goeth (far) astray.",His exalted be He is the call of truth that is the words that constitute it the truth and these are ‘there is no god but God’ lā ilāha illā’Llāh; and those upon whom they call read yad‘ūn or tad‘ūn ‘you call’ those whom they worship apart from Him that is other than Him — namely the idols — do not answer them anything of which they ask; save as is the response to one who stretches forth his hands towards water at the edge of a well calling to it that it may reach his mouth by its rising through the well to reach him but it would never reach it that is reach his mouth ever likewise they the idols will not answer them; and the call of the disbelievers their worship of idols — or their actual supplication — goes only astray it is only in perdition.

As for the scum of the flood and of the minerals smelted it passes away as dross useless refuse while that which is of use to mankind in the way of water and minerals lingers remains in the earth for a time likewise falsehood wanes and is eventually effaced even if it should prevail over the truth at certain times.

The following was revealed when the Companions were keen that what was requested of signs should be manifested hoping that they the ones requesting them might believe Have they not realised those who believe that an is softened in other words understand it as annahu had God willed He could have guided all mankind? to faith without the need for any sign? And the disbelievers from among the people of Mecca continue to be struck by devastation a catastrophe that devastates them through all manner of hardship such as being killed taken captive and suffering war or drought because of what they wrought because of their actions that is their disbelief; or you alight O Muhammad (s) together with your army near their home — Mecca — until God’s promise of victory against them comes to pass; truly God does not break His promise and indeed he alighted at Hudaybiyya until the conquest of Mecca took place;
The Thunder,13,32,"And verily messengers (of Allah) were mocked before thee, but long I bore with those who disbelieved. At length I seized them, and how (awful) was My punishment!",messengers were certainly mocked before you in the same way that you have been mocked — this is meant as solace for the Prophet s — but I gave respite to those who disbelieved; then I seized them with retribution and how was My retribution? that is to say it My retribution will come to pass; and I shall deal with those who have mocked you in the same way.
The Thunder,13,33,"Is He Who is aware of the deserts of every soul (as he who is aware of nothing) ? Yet they ascribe unto Allah partners. Say: Name them. Is it that ye would inform Him of something which He knoweth not in the earth ? Or is it but a way of speaking ? Nay but their contrivance is made seeming fair for those who disbelieve and they are kept from the right road. He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no guide.",Is He Who stands watches over every soul what it has earned? what it has done of good or evil — and this is God — like the idols who are not so? No! This response is suggested by the following words Yet they ascribe to God associates. Say ‘Name them! for Him who are they? Or will you inform Him will you inform God of something that is of an associate which He does not know in the earth? an interrogative of disavowal; in other words He has no associate for if He did He would know him — exalted be He above such a thing. Or is it — nay — you call them associates merely a manner of speaking?’ that is it is merely on the basis of false conjecture without any truth in it. Nay but their scheming their unbelief has been adorned for those who disbelieve and they have been barred from the way from the path of guidance; and whomever God sends astray for him there is no guide.
The Thunder,13,34,"For them is torment in the life of the world, and verily the doom of the Hereafter is more painful, and they have no defender from Allah.",For them there is chastisement in the life of this world through being killed or taken captive; and verily the chastisement of the Hereafter is more grievous is more severe; and they have no defender protector from God that is from His chastisement.

That namely Paradise is the reward the sequel of those who were wary of idolatry and the requital of the disbelievers is the Fire!
The Thunder,13,36,"Those unto whom We gave the Scripture rejoice in that which is revealed unto thee. And of the clans there are who deny some of it. Say: I am commanded only that I serve Allah and ascribe unto Him no partner. Unto Him I cry, and unto Him is my return.",And those to whom We have given the Scripture such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and others from among the believing Jews rejoice in that which has been revealed to you because of its according with what they have with them of revelation; and among the factions that aligned themselves against you in enmity from among the idolaters and the Jews are those who reject some of it such as the mention of the ‘Compassionate One’ al-Rahmān and all that is other than the stories related therein. Say ‘I have been commanded — in that which has been revealed to me — only to worship God and not to associate anything with Him. To Him I call and to Him shall be my return’.

The Thunder,13,40,"Whether We let thee see something of that which We have promised them, or make thee die (before its happening), thine is but conveyance (of the message). Ours the reckoning.",And whether read as immā the nūn of the conditional particle in ‘whether’ has been assimiliated with the extra mā We show you a part of that which We promise them of chastisement during your lifetime the response of the conditional statement has been omitted in other words understand it as being fa-dhāk ‘then so shall it be’; or We take you to Us before chastising them; it is for you only to convey the Message your duty is only to deliver the Message and it is for Us to do the reckoning when they finally come to Us whereupon We shall requite them.

The Thunder,13,42,Those who were before them plotted; but all plotting is Allah’s. He knoweth that which each soul earneth. The disbelievers will come to know for whom will be the sequel of the (heavenly) Home.,And indeed those that were before them of communities plotted against their prophets just as they plot against you; but to God belongs all plotting. And nor is their plotting like the plotting of God for exalted be He He knows what every soul earns and so its requital is prepared for it and this is the ultimate plotting since He brings it to them whence they are not aware.

He is the Mighty, the Wise.",And We have not sent any Messenger except with the tongue with the language of his people that he might make the Message clear to them that he might make them understand what he brings to them; God then sends astray whomever He will and He guides whomever He will; and He is the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise in His actions.

The meaning is that to Him they assign daughters to whom they are averse when in any case He is exalted beyond having offspring while to themselves they assign sons of their own choosing so that the best is theirs exclusively — like where God says Now ask them are daughters to be for your Lord while sons are to be for them? Q. 37149.

He is the Mighty, the Wise.",For those who do not believe in the Hereafter namely for the disbelievers there is an evil description in other words theirs is the most evil attribute meaning the most vile which is their burying alive of newborn girls despite the fact that they are needed for the purposes of marriage; and the loftiest description belongs to God His is the attribute most sublime namely that there is no god except Him.

But Satan adorned for them their deeds their evil deeds so that they considered them to be good deeds and therefore they denied the messengers. So he is their patron the guardian of their affairs today that is now in this world and for them there will be a painful chastisement in the Hereafter. It is also said that by al-yawm ‘today’ is meant the Day of Resurrection narrating the events as though they are taking place now. In other words they have no guardian other than him in other words Satan and as he is incapable of helping himself how could he possibly help them?

The Prophet s used to prescribe it for anyone suffering from stomach pains as reported by the two Shaykhs Bukhārī and Muslim. Surely in that there is a sign for a people who reflect upon God’s handiwork exalted be He.
The Bee,16,70,"And Allah createth you, then causeth you to die, and among you is he who is brought back to the most abject stage of life, so that he knoweth nothing after (having had) knowledge. Lo! Allah is Knower, Powerful.",And God has created you when you were nothing then He takes you in death when your terms of life are concluded; and there are some among you who are relegated to the most abject stage of life that is the most diminished because of old-age and senility so that he knows nothing after having possessed some knowledge. ‘Ikrima said ‘Whoever recites the Qur’ān will not come to such a predicament’. God is Knowing of how to manage the affairs of His creation Powerful in doing what He will.
The Bee,16,71,"And Allah hath favoured some of you above others in provision. Now those who are more favoured will by no means hand over their provision to those (slaves) whom their right hands possess, so that they may be equal with them in respect thereof. Is it then the grace of Allah that they deny ?",And God has favoured some of you above others in respect of provision thus some of you are poor some are rich some owners others are owned. Now those who have been more favoured namely the masters would not hand over their provision to those slaves whom their right hands possess that is they would not assign that wealth and other things which We have given them as something to be shared equally between them and their slaves so that they that is the slaves and their masters become equal partners in respect thereof. The meaning is they do not have partners from among their slaves in respect of their wealth so how can they make certain of God’s servants partners of His? Is it then the grace of God that they deny? that they reject when they ascribe partners to Him?
The Bee,16,72,"And Allah hath given you wives of your own kind, and hath given you, from your wives, sons and grandsons, and hath made provision of good things for you. Is it then in vanity that they believe and in the grace of Allah that they disbelieve ?",And God made for you mates from your own selves thus He created Eve from Adam’s rib and created all mankind from the seminal fluids of men and women and made for you from your mates children and grandchildren and He provided you with the good things of all kinds of fruits seeds and animals. Is it then in falsehood in the idol that they believe and in the grace of God that they disbelieve? when they associate others with God?
The Bee,16,73,"And they worship beside Allah that which owneth no provision whatsoever for them from the heavens or the earth, nor have they (whom they worship) any power.",And they worship besides God that is other than Him what has no power to give them any sort of provision from the heavens such as water and the earth such as plants shay’an ‘anything’ is a substitute for rizqan ‘provision’ nor do they have the capacity nor are they able to do anything — and these are the idols.
The Bee,16,74,So coin not similitudes for Allah. Lo! Allah knoweth; ye know not.,So do not strike any similitude for God do not ascribe to God likenesses and then associate them with Him in power. Truly God knows that there is nothing like Him and you do not know this.
The Bee,16,75,"Allah coineth a similitude: (on the one hand) a (mere) chattel slave, who hath control of nothing, and (on the other hand) one on whom we have bestowed a fair provision from Us, and he spendeth thereof secretly and openly. Are they equal ? Praise be to Allah! But most of them know not.",God strikes a similitude mathalan this is substituted by the following ‘abdan mamlūkan a slave who is a chattel mamlūkan an adjective to distinguish him this type of slave from a free man who is the servant of God alone having no power over anything since he has no mastery and one on whom man is an indefinite noun adjectivally qualified in other words a free man We have bestowed a fair provision from Us such that he spends thereof secretly and openly that is disposing of it as he wishes the first similitude is for the idols while the second is His exalted be He. Are they equal? the powerless slaves and the dispensing free men? No. Praise belongs to God alone. But most of them that is the people of Mecca do not know the chastisement they will come to and so they associate others with God.
The Bee,16,76,"And Allah coineth a similitude: Two men, one of them dumb, having control of nothing, and he is a burden on his owner; whithersoever he directeth him to go, he bringeth no good. Is he equal with one who enjoineth justice and followeth a straight path (of conduct) ?",And God strikes a similitude mathalan this is substituted by the following rajulayn two men one of whom is dumb from birth having no power over anything as he cannot understand nor be understood and who is a liability burdensome to his master — the legal guardian of his affairs — wherever he directs him he does not bring therefrom any good he does not succeed and this is the similitude of the disbeliever. Is he that is the dumb one mentioned equal to one who enjoins justice that is to one who is able to speak of benefit to people since he enjoins it justice and encourages others to it and follows a path a way that is straight? — this being the second man the believer — No he is not equal to him. It is also said that this last similitude is a similitude of God while the similitude of the dumb one is of the idols so that the preceding verse contains the similitude of the disbeliever and the believer.
The Bee,16,77,"And unto Allah belongeth the Unseen of the heavens and the earth, and the matter of the Hour (of Doom) is but as a twinkling of the eye, or it is nearer still. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.",And to God belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth in other words the knowledge of what is hidden in them. And the matter of the Hour is but as the twinkling of an eye or it is even nearer since it takes place as a result of the words ‘Be’ and it is kun fa-yakūn. Truly God has power over all things.
The Bee,16,78,"And Allah brought you forth from the wombs of your mothers knowing nothing, and gave you hearing and sight and hearts that haply ye might give thanks.",And God brought you forth from the bellies of your mothers while you did not know anything the statement lā ta‘lamūna shay’an ‘while you did not know anything’ is a circumstantial qualifier and He gave you hearing and sight and hearts that perhaps you might give thanks to Him for this gift and become believers.
The Bee,16,79,"Have they not seen the birds obedient in mid-air ? None holdeth them save Allah. Lo! herein, verily, are portents for a people who believe.",Have they not observed the birds how they are made subservient disposed to be able to fly in the air of heaven? that is in the air between the heaven and the earth. Nothing holds them when they draw in their wings or open them lest they fall except God by His power. Indeed in that there are signs for a people who believe the signs which are that they have been created in a way that enables them to fly as well as the creation of the air in such a way that it allows for flight and the holding of them up in the air so that they do not fall.
The Bee,16,80,"And Allah hath given you in your houses an abode, and hath given you (also), of the hides of cattle, houses which ye find light (to carry) on the day of migration and on the day of pitching camp; and of their wool and their fur and their hair, caparison and comfort for a while.",And it is God Who has made for you your homes as a place of rest a place that you can inhabit and He has made for you out of the skins of the cattle homes such as tents and pavilions which you find light to carry on the day of your migration your travel and on the day of your halting; and of their wool that is the sheep’s and their fur that is the camels’ and their hair that is the goats’ He has made for you furniture chattels such as rugs and blankets and wares for you to use for a while until they perish.
The Bee,16,81,"And Allah hath given you, of that which He hath created, shelter from the sun; and hath given you places of refuge in the mountains, and hath given you coats to ward off the heat from you, and coats (of armour) to save you from your own foolhardiness. Thus doth He perfect His favour unto you, in order that ye may surrender (unto Him).",And it is God Who has made for you from what He created of houses trees and clouds shade zilāl is the plural of zill to protect you from the heat of the sun; and He has made for you in the mountains places of refuge aknān is the plural of kinn which is a places where one can seek shelter istakanna such as a cave or a tunnel; and He has made for you garments shirts that protect you from the heat that is and also from the cold and garments that protect you from your mutual violence your warring in other words to protect you from stabbed or struck during these instances garments such as coats of mail and armour plates. So in the same way that He has created these things He perfects His favour — in this world — to you by creating that of which you have need so that you O people of Mecca might submit that you might affirm His Oneness.
The Bee,16,82,"Then, if they turn away, thy duty (O Muhammad) is but plain conveyance (of the message).",But if they turn away if they reject Islam your duty O Muhammad (s) is only to convey the Message plainly — this was revealed before the command to fight the disbelievers.
The Bee,16,83,They know the favour of Allah and then deny it. Most of them are ingrates.,They recognise God’s grace that is they affirm that it comes from Him and then deny it by associating others with Him and most of them are ungrateful.
The Bee,16,84,"And (bethink you of) the day when we raise up of every nation a witness, then there is no leave for disbelievers, nor are they allowed to make amends.",And mention the day We shall raise up from every community a witness and this will be it that community’s prophet to bear witness for it and against it and this day is the Day of Resurrection; then the disbelievers will not be given permission to make excuses nor will they be asked to make amends that is nor will they be asked to repent and return to that which pleases God.
The Bee,16,85,"And when those who did wrong behold the doom, it will not be made light for them, nor will they be reprieved.",And when those who did wrong those who disbelieved behold the chastisement the Fire it shall not be lightened for them the chastisement nor will they be granted any respite any deferment from it when they see it.
The Bee,16,86,"And when those who ascribed partners to Allah behold those partners of theirs, they will say: Our Lord! these are our partners unto whom we used to cry instead of Thee. But they will fling to them the saying: Lo! ye verily are liars!",And when the idolaters behold their associates of devils and others they will say ‘Our Lord these are our associates whom we used to invoke whom we used to worship besides You’. But they will fling to them the saying that is they will say to them ‘You are indeed liars!’ when you say that you used to worship us — as is stated by them in another verse ‘It was not us that they worshipped’ Q. 2863; and also in the verse They will deny their worship of them Q. 1982.
The Bee,16,87,"And they proffer unto Allah submission on that day, and all that they used to invent hath failed them.",And they will offer submission to God on that day that is they will have surrendered to His judgement and that which they used to invent in the way of claiming that their gods intercede for them will fail forsake them.
The Bee,16,88,"For those who disbelieve and debar (men) from the way of Allah, We add doom to doom because they wrought corruption,",Those who disbelieve and bar people from the way of God from His religion them We shall add chastisement to their chastisement that chastisement which they have merited for their disbelief — Ibn Mas‘ūd said ‘Their chastisment will consist of scorpions whose fangs are as long as the tallest palm trees’ — because of the corruption they used to cause by their barring people from belief.
The Bee,16,89,"And (bethink you of) the day when We raise in every nation a witness against them of their own folk, and We bring thee (Muhammad) as a witness against these. And We reveal the Scripture unto thee as an exposition of all things, and a guidance and a mercy and good tidings for those who have surrendered (to Allah).",And mention the day We shall raise up from every community a witness against them from among themselves and this will be their that community’s prophet and We shall bring you O Muhammad (s) as a witness against these namely your people. And We have revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān as a clarification of all things that people might need concerning the Law and as a guidance from error and a mercy and good tidings of Paradise to those who submit those who affirm the Oneness of God.
The Bee,16,90,"Lo! Allah enjoineth justice and kindness, and giving to kinsfolk, and forbiddeth lewdness and abomination and wickedness. He exhorteth you in order that ye may take heed.",Indeed God enjoins justice — that is affirmation of His Oneness or actually being fair and virtue performance of the religious obligations or that you should worship God as if you were able to see Him as reported in the hadīth; and giving to kinsfolk — He has singled it kinship out for mention by way of highlighting its importance — and He forbids lewdness fornication and abomination with regard to the stipulations of the Law abomination such as disbelief and acts of disobedience and aggression wrongdoing against people — He also singles this out for mention by way of showing its importance; just as He began with the mention of ‘lewdness’ in this way He admonishes you through commands and prohibitions so that you might remember that you might be admonished tadhakkarūna ‘you might remember’ the original tā’ of tatadhakkarūna has been assimilated with the dhāl. In the Mustadrak of al-Hākim al-Naysābūrī it is reported from Ibn Mas‘ūd that he said ‘This verse is the most comprehensive verse in the Qur’ān in terms of what is good and what is evil’.
The Bee,16,91,"Fulfil the covenant of Allah when ye have covenanted, and break not your oaths after the asseveration of them, and after ye have made Allah surety over you. Lo! Allah knoweth what ye do.",And fulfil God’s covenant effected by way of pledges of allegiance and oaths and in other ways when you made a covenant and do not break your oaths after pledging them and having made God surety over you that you will fulfill the covenant for you have sworn the oath by Him the sentence wa-qad ja‘altumu’Llāha ‘alaykum kafīlan ‘and having made God surety over you’ is a circumstantial qualifier. Truly God knows what you do — this is a threat for them.
The Bee,16,92,"And be not like unto her who unravelleth the thread, after she hath made it strong, to thin filaments, making your oaths a deceit between you because of a nation being more numerous than (another) nation. Allah only trieth you thereby, and He verily will explain to you on the Day of Resurrection that wherein ye differed.",And do not be like her who undoes spoils her yarn that which she has spun after having made it strong having set and spun it breaking it up into fibres ankāthan is a circumstantial qualifier ankāth is the plural of nikth and means that which is undone yunkathu — this was an imbecile Meccan woman who used to spin all day and then undo it — by making tattakhidhūna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the verb takūnū ‘do not be like’ in other words what is meant is ‘do not be like her by making’ your oaths a means of deceit dakhal is what enters yadkhulu into something but does not belong to it in other words as a means of causing mischief or as trickery between you by breaking these oaths so that one group may become more numerous than another group. They used to enter into an alliance with a given group but if they encountered another more numerous and more powerful group they would renege on their alliance with the former and forge a new alliance with these latter. God only tries tests you thereby in other words by that which He enjoins in the way of fulfilling the covenant so that He may observe the obedient and the disobedient among you or when it is the case that one group is more numerous than another that He may observe whether you fulfil your obligation to them or not; and certainly He will make clear to you on the Day of Resurrection that wherein you used to differ during the life of this world with regard to covenants and otherwise by punishing he who reneged and rewarding he who was faithful to his covenant.
The Bee,16,93,"Had Allah willed He could have made you (all) one nation, but He sendeth whom He will astray and guideth whom He will, and ye will indeed be asked of what ye used to do.",For if God had willed He could have made you one community people of a single religion but He leads astray whom He will and guides whom He will and you will surely be questioned on the Day of Resurrection a questioning of rebuke about what you used to do so that you might be requited for it.
The Bee,16,94,"Make not your oaths a deceit between you, lest a foot should slip after being firmly planted and ye should taste evil forasmuch as ye debarred (men) from the way of Allah, and yours should be an awful doom.",And do not make your oaths a means of deceit between you — He repeats this here for emphasis — lest a foot should slip that is lest your feet should slip off the path of Islam after being steady having been set upon it and lest you should taste evil that is chastisement forasmuch as you barred people from the way of God in other words for your refraining to fulfil covenants or barring others from doing this since your custom once established will be followed by others and there be a tremendous chastisement for you in the Hereafter.
The Bee,16,95,"And purchase not a small gain at the price of Allah’s covenant. Lo! that which Allah hath is better for you, if ye did but know.",And do not sell God’s covenant for a small price of this world so that you break it in return for this small price. For truly what is with God of reward is better for you than all that is in this world — if you should know this then do not break it.

And verily We shall pay those who are steadfast a recompense in proportion to the best of what they used to do.",That which is with you of the things of this world will come to an end will perish but that which is with God remains it is everlasting. And He shall surely pay read la-yajziyanna or la-najziyanna ‘We shall surely pay’ those who were patient in fulfilling their covenants their reward according to the best of what they used to do ‘the best’ here means ‘the good’.

This is said to be life in Paradise; or it is life on earth when it is one of contentedness or one of wholesome halāl provision. And We shall surely pay them their reward according to the best of what they used to do.
The Bee,16,98,"And when thou recitest the Qur’an, seek refuge in Allah from Satan the outcast.",And when you recite the Qur’ān that is when you intend to recite it seek refuge in God from Satan the outcast in other words say a‘ūdhu bi’Lllāhi min al-shaytān al-rajīm ‘I seek refuge in God from the accursed Satan’.
The Bee,16,99,Lo! he hath no power over those who believe and put trust in their Lord.,Indeed he has no power sway over those who believe and put their trust in their Lord.
The Bee,16,100,"His power is only over those who make a friend of him, and those who ascribe partners unto Him (Allah).",His Satan’s power is only over those who choose him as their patron by obeying him and those who ascribe partners to Him that is to God.
The Bee,16,101,"And when We put a revelation in place of (another) revelation, - and Allah knoweth best what He revealeth - they say: Lo! thou art but inventing. Most of them know not.",And when We exchange a verse in place of a different verse by abrogating it and revealing another for the welfare of God’s servants — and God knows best what He reveals — they say that is the disbelievers say to the Prophet s ‘You are just a fabricator’ a liar making it up yourself. Nay most of them do not know the true nature of the Qur’ān and the benefit to God’s servants of abrogation.
The Bee,16,102,"Say: The holy Spirit hath delivered it from thy Lord with truth, that it may confirm (the faith of) those who believe, and as guidance and good tidings for those who have surrendered (to Allah).",Say to them ‘The Holy Spirit Gabriel has revealed it from your Lord with truth bi’l-haqq this is semantically connected to nazzala ‘he Gabriel has revealed it’ to confirm the faith of those who believe by their believing in it when it is revealed and as guidance and good tidings for those who have submitted to God’.
The Bee,16,103,"And We know well that they say: Only a man teacheth him. The speech of him at whom they falsely hint is outlandish, and this is clear Arabic speech.",And verily wa-laqad is for confirmation We know that they say ‘It is only a human that is teaching him the Qur’ān’ — this was a Christian blacksmith whom the Prophet s used to frequent. God exalted be He says The tongue the language of him to whom they refer to whom they incline with the accusation that he is the one teaching him is foreign’; while this Qur’ān is in a clear Arabic tongue one of lucidity and clarity so how can a foreigner be teaching him?
The Bee,16,104,"Lo! those who disbelieve the revelations of Allah, Allah guideth them not and theirs will be a painful doom.",Indeed those who do not believe in God’s signs — God shall not guide them and there is a painful chastisement for them.
The Bee,16,105,"Only they invent falsehood who believe not Allah’s revelations, and (only) they are the liars.",Only those invent falsehood who do not believe in God’s signs the Qur’an by saying that these are the words of a human and it is they who are the liars the emphasis is effected by way of repetition; wa-inna ‘and indeed’ and other combinations of inna are used in refutation of their saying ‘You are just a fabricator’ above Q. 16101.
The Bee,16,106,Whoso disbelieveth in Allah after his belief - save him who is forced thereto and whose heart is still content with the Faith - but whoso findeth ease in disbelief: On them is wrath from Allah. Theirs will be an awful doom.,Whoever disbelieves in God after having affirmed his faith — except for him who is compelled to pronounce a statement of unbelief and so pronounces it while his heart is at rest in faith man ‘whoever’ is either a subject or a conditional and so the predicate of this subject or the response to this conditional is an implied lahum wa‘īdun shadīd ‘there is for them a severe threat of chastisement’; this is indicated by the statement that follows — but he who opens up his breast to unbelief that is he who opens it up and expands it with unbelief meaning that his soul is content with it upon such shall be wrath from God and there is a great chastisement for them.
The Bee,16,107,"That is because they have chosen the life of the world rather than the Hereafter, and because Allah guideth not the disbelieving folk.",That threat of chastisement for them is because they have preferred the life of this world they have chosen it in preference to the Hereafter and because God does not guide the disbelieving folk.
The Bee,16,108,Such are they whose hearts and ears and eyes Allah hath sealed. And such are the heedless.,They are the ones on whose hearts God has set a seal and on their hearing and their sight as well and it is they who are heedless of what punishment is being prepared for them.
The Bee,16,109,Assuredly in the Hereafter they are the losers.,Without a doubt — verily — in the Hereafter they are the ones who will be the losers because their journey’s end shall be the Fire in which they shall be perpetually.
The Bee,16,110,"Then lo! thy Lord - for those who became fugitives after they had been persecuted, and then fought and were steadfast - lo! thy Lord afterward is (for them) indeed Forgiving, Merciful.",Then indeed your Lord — as for those who emigrated to Medina after they were persecuted after they were tortured and compelled to pronounce words of unbelief a variant reading for futinū ‘they were persecuted’ has fatanū in other words ‘after they disbelieved’ or ‘after they turned people away from belief’ and then struggled and were patient in obedience — indeed your Lord after that that is after such a trial is Forgiving of them Merciful to them the predicate of the first inna ‘indeed’ is indicated by the predicate of the second one.
The Bee,16,111,"On the Day when every soul will come pleading for itself, and every soul will be repaid what it did, and they will not be wronged.",Mention the day when every soul will come pleading arguing for itself not concerned for any other soul — this is the Day of Resurrection — and every soul will be repaid the requital of what it has done and they will not be wronged at all.
The Bee,16,112,"Allah coineth a similitude: a township that dwelt secure and well content, its provision coming to it in abundance from every side, but it disbelieved in Allah’s favours, so Allah made it experience the garb of dearth and fear because of what they used to do.",And God strikes a similitude mathalan is substituted by the following qaryatan a town Mecca — meaning its inhabitants — secure from any raids never becoming agitated and peaceful without anyone ever needing to emigrate from it on account of anxiety or fear its provision coming to it plenteously abundantly from every place. But it rejected God’s graces by denying the Prophet s so God made it taste the garb of hunger and so they suffered seven years of drought and fear as a result of the raiding parties of the Prophet s all because of what they used to do.

Yet whoever is compelled neither craving nor transgressing then truly God is Forgiving Merciful.
The Bee,16,116,"And speak not, concerning that which your own tongues qualify (as clean or unclean), the falsehood: ""This is lawful, and this is forbidden,"" so that ye invent a lie against Allah. Lo! those who invent a lie against Allah will not succeed.",And do not say concerning that which your own tongues qualify falsehood such as ‘This is lawful and this is unlawful’ for what God respectively has not made lawful and what He has not made unlawful in order to invent lies against God by attributing such claims to Him. Truly those who invent lies against God will not prosper.
The Bee,16,117,A brief enjoyment (will be theirs); and theirs a painful doom.,For them there will be a brief enjoyment in this world and for them in the Hereafter there will be a painful chastisement.
The Bee,16,118,"And unto those who are Jews We have forbidden that which We have already related unto thee. And We wronged them not, but they were wont to wrong themselves.",And to those of Jewry that is the Jews We forbade that which We have related to you already in the verse And to those of Jewry We forbade every beast with hoof … to the end Q. 6146; and We did not wrong them by forbidding them that but they used to wrong themselves by committing acts of disobedience which necessarily bring about such consequences.

(for them) thy Lord is afterward indeed Forgiving, Merciful.",Then indeed your Lord — to those who did evil associating others with God out of ignorance and then repented returned to God’s way after that and made amends in their actions — indeed your Lord after that that is after that ignorance or that repentance is Forgiving of them Merciful to them.

The Bee,16,123,"And afterward We inspired thee (Muhammad, saying): Follow the religion of Abraham, as one by nature upright. He was not of the idolaters.",Then We revealed to you O Muhammad (s) saying ‘Follow the creed the religion of Abraham a hanīf and he was not of the idolaters’ this remark is repeated in order to refute to the claim of the Jews and Christians that they follow his religion.

They were commanded to devote themselves solely to worship on Friday but they said ‘We do not want it’ and chose Saturday; consequently thereon the observance of it was enforced strictly on them; and lo! your Lord will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection concerning that wherein they used to differ with regard this matter of the Sabbath by rewarding the obedient and chastising the one who disobeyed by his violating its sanctity.

Truly your Lord knows best that is He is fully knowledgeable of those who stray from His way and He knows best those who are guided and will requite them — this was revealed before the command to fight them.
The Bee,16,126,"If ye punish, then punish with the like of that wherewith ye were afflicted. But if ye endure patiently, verily it is better for the patient.",After Hamza b. ‘Abd al-Muttalib had been killed and mutilated and the Prophet s had seen him and said ‘Verily I will mutilate 70 of them for you’ the following was revealed And if you retaliate retaliate with the like of what you have been made to suffer; and yet if you endure patiently refraining from revenge verily that namely that enduring is better for the patient. Thus the Prophet s refrained from taking revenge and made atonement for his oath as reported by al-Bazzār.

The Children of Israel,17,1,"Glorified be He Who carried His servant by night from the Inviolable Place of Worship to the Far distant place of worship the neighbourhood whereof We have blessed, that We might show him of Our tokens! Lo! He, only He, is the Hearer, the Seer.",Glory be to Him — an affirmation of God’s transcendence — Who carried His servant Muhammad (s) by night laylan is in the accusative as an adverbial qualification; isrā’ means ‘to travel by night’; what is instructive about this mention of laylan ‘by night’ is that through its being indefinite there is an indication of the brevity of its duration from the Sacred Mosque that is Mecca to the Farthest Mosque the Holy House of Jerusalem so called because of its distance from the former; the environs of which We have blessed with fruits and rivers that We might show him some of Our signs the marvels of Our power. Indeed He is the Hearing the Seeing that is to say the Knower of the Prophet’s s sayings and deeds. Thus He God was gracious to him by way of carrying him on the night journey which comprised his encountering the other prophets his ascension to heaven and the sight of the marvels of the Divine Realm and His communion exalted be He with him. For he the Prophet s said ‘I was brought al-Burāq a white animal larger than a donkey but smaller than a mule; it was able to place its hoof back towards its extremity and so I mounted it. It set off carrying me until I reached the Holy House of Jerusalem. There I fastened the animal to the ring where the prophets fasten their animals. I then went in and prayed two units inside it. As I came out Gabriel came to me with a jug of wine and a jug of milk and so I chose the milk. Gabriel said to me “You have made the right choice by choosing the primordial nature fitra”.’ He the Prophet continued the narration ‘We then ascended to the heaven of this world whereat Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked “Who are you?”. He replied “Gabriel” “And who is with you?” “Muhammad (s)” he said. “Has he been sent for?”. “Yes he has been sent for”. Then it was opened for us and lo! Adam stood before me; he greeted me and prayed for well-being for me. We then ascended to the second heaven and Gabriel asked to be let in. Someone asked “Who are you?”. He replied “Gabriel” “And who is with you?” “Muhammad (s)” he said.

And assuredly they did revert by denying the Prophet s and so he was given power over them through the slaying of the Banū Qurayza the expulsion of the Banū Nadīr and the exacting of the jizya-tax from them; and We have made Hell a dungeon for the disbelievers a place of detention and a prison for them.

And magnify Him with all magnificence.",And say ‘Praise be to God Who has neither taken a son nor has He any partner in sovereignty in divineness nor has He taken any ally to assist Him out of because of any weakness’ that is to say He would never become weak and thus need an assistant. And magnify Him with magnifications worthy of Him extol Him with a perfect extolling above that He should have taken a son or a partner and above any weakness and above all that does not befit Him. The arrangement whereby ‘praise’ is invoked together with this statement is meant to indicate that He is the One worthy of all praise because of the perfection of His Essence and the fact that He alones possesses those attributes of His. Imam Ahmad b. Hanbal relates in his Musnad by way of a report from Mu‘ādh al-Juhanī who heard it from the Messenger of God s who used to say ‘The “glory” verse in the Qur’ān is Praise be to God Who has neither taken a son nor has He any partner in sovereignty … to the end of the above-mentioned sūra 17111’ and God exalted be He knows best. The author of this commentary says ‘This last commentary constitutes the end of my complement to the commentary on the Noble Qur’ān composed by the inquisitive scholar the shaykh Imam Jalāl al-Dīn al-Mahallī al-Shāfi‘ī may God be pleased with him. I have expended every effort in it and reflected throughout it exhaustively especially in those precious things that I have deemed God willing to be profitable. I composed it this commentary in the same length of time appointed for the one spoken to by God sc. Moses and I have made it a means to attaining the Gardens of Bliss. It this commentary actually draws on the work which it complements relying and depending on it for an understanding of those allegorical verses. May God have mercy on one who examines it with impartiality chances upon an error and informs me of it. As I have said “I praise God my Lord for He guided me in what I have expressed despite my incapacity and weakness; for who other than God is there to avert me from error and who is there to accept from me even a single letter”.

And who doth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah ?",These hā’ūlā’ is the subject of the sentence our people qawmunā is an explicative supplement to the subject have taken gods besides Him. Why if what they claim is true do they not bring some clear warrant some manifest argument regarding them? regarding worship of these idols. And who does greater wrong — in other words no one does greater wrong — than he who invents a lie against God? by ascribing partners to Him exalted be He. Some among the youths said to the others
The Cave,18,16,"And when ye withdraw from them and that which they worship except Allah, then seek refuge in the Cave; your Lord will spread for you of His mercy and will prepare for you a pillow in your plight.",And when you withdraw from them and from that which they worship except God then take refuge in the Cave. Your Lord will reveal for you something of His mercy and prepare for you in your affair some comfort’ read mirfaqan or marfiqan that is to say something for you to find comfort in in the way of lunch or supper.
The Cave,18,17,"And thou mightest have seen the sun when it rose move away from their cave to the right, and when it set go past them on the left, and they were in the cleft thereof. That was (one) of the portents of Allah. He whom Allah guideth, he indeed is led aright, and he whom He sendeth astray, for him thou wilt not find a guiding friend.",And you might have seen the sun when it rose inclining read tazzāwaru or tazāwaru away from their Cave towards the right side of it and when it set go past them on the left avoid them and pass over them so that it does not fall on them at all while they were in a cavern therein in an ample space inside the Cave where the coolness and the gentle breeze of the winds reached them. That which is mentioned was one of God’s signs one of the proofs of His power. Whomever God guides he indeed is rightly guided and whomever He leads astray you will not find for him a guiding friend.
The Cave,18,18,"And thou wouldst have deemed them waking though they were asleep, and We caused them to turn over to the right and the left, and their dog stretching out his paws on the threshold. If thou hadst observed them closely thou hadst assuredly turned away from them in flight, and hadst been filled with awe of them.",And you would have supposed them — had you seen them — awake that is conscious because their eyes were open ayqāz ‘awake’ is the plural of yaqiz though they were asleep ruqūd is the plural of rāqid. And We caused them to turn over to the right and to the left lest the earth consume their flesh and their dog lay stretching its forelegs his paws on the threshold at the opening of the cave whenever they turned over it would turn over just like them both during sleep and consciousness. If you had observed them you would have turned away from them in flight and you would have been filled read la-mulli’ta or la-muli’ta with awe because of them read ru‘ban or ru‘uban ‘awe’ it was through this awe that God protected them from anyone entering upon them.
The Cave,18,19,"And in like manner We awakened them that they might question one another. A speaker from among them said: How long have ye tarried ? They said: We have tarried a day or some part of a day, (Others) said: Your Lord best knoweth what ye have tarried. Now send one of you with this your silver coin unto the city, and let him see what food is purest there and bring you a supply thereof. Let him be courteous and let no man know of you.",And so just as We did with them that which We have mentioned it was that We aroused them We awakened them that they might question one another concerning their state and the length of their stay in the cave. One of them said ‘How long have you tarried?’ They said ‘We have tarried a day or part of a day’ he said this because they had entered the cave at sunrise and were awakened at sunset and so they thought that it was the time of sunset on the day of their entry. Then they said unsure about this fact ‘Your Lord knows best how long you have tarried. Now send one of you with this silver coin of yours read bi-warqikum or bi-wariqikum to the city — which is said to be the one now called Tarsus Tarasūs — and let him see which is the purest food that is which of the foods of the city is the purest and let him bring you a supply thereof. Let him be careful and not make anyone aware of you.
The Cave,18,20,"For they, if they should come to know of you, will stone you or turn you back to their religion; then ye will never prosper.",For indeed if they should come to know of you they will either stone you kill you by stoning or make you return to their creed and then if you do return to their creed you will never prosper’.
The Cave,18,21,"And in like manner We disclosed them (to the people of the city) that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that, as for the Hour, there is no doubt concerning it. When (the people of the city) disputed of their case among themselves, they said: Build over them a building; their Lord knoweth best concerning them. Those who won their point said: We verily shall build a place of worship over them.",And so just as We aroused them it was that We disclosed them to their people and the believers that they that is their people might know that God’s promise of resurrection is true by virtue of the fact that One Who has the power to make them sleep for such a long period of time or sustain them in that state without nourishment also has the power to resurrect the dead; and that as for the Hour there is no doubt no uncertainty concerning it. Behold idh adverbially qualifies a‘tharnā ‘We disclosed’ they were disputing that is the believers and the disbelievers among themselves their affair the affair of the youths with regard to building something around them as a monument; so they the disbelievers said ‘Build over them that is around them a building to cover them up; their Lord knows them best.’ Those who prevailed regarding their affair the affair of the youths namely the believers ‘We will verily set up over them around them a place of worship’ for prayers to be performed therein. And this indeed took place at the entrance of the cave.
The Cave,18,22,"(Some) will say: They were three, their dog the fourth, and (some) say: Five, their dog the sixth, guessing at random; and (some) say: Seven, and their dog the eighth. Say (O Muhammad): My Lord is Best Aware of their number. None knoweth them save a few. So contend not concerning them except with an outward contending, and ask not any of them to pronounce concerning them.",They will say that is some of those disputing the number of the youths of the cave at the time of the Prophet s in other words some of these will say that they the youths were ‘Three; their dog the fourth of them’; and they some others among them will say ‘Five; their dog the sixth of them’ — both of these sayings were those of the Christians of Najrān — guessing at random in other words out of supposition not having been present with them at the time and this statement ‘guessing at random’ refers back to both sayings and is in the accusative because it is an object denoting reason in other words they said this for the reason that they were merely supposing it. And they that is the believers will say ‘Seven; and their dog the eighth of them’ the sentence is part of the subject clause the predicate of which is the adjectival qualification of sab‘a ‘seven’ namely thāminuhum ‘the eighth of them’ with the additional wāw wa-thāminuhum which is said to be for emphasis or an indication that the adjective is semantically attached to that which it is qualifying. The qualification of the first two sayings as being ‘random’ but not the third is proof that the latter is the satisfactory and correct number. Say ‘My Lord knows best their number and none knows them except a few’ Ibn ‘Abbās said ‘I am one of these “few” described’ and he mentioned that they were seven. So do not contend concerning them except with an outward manner of contention except with that which has been revealed to you and do not question concerning them do not ask for opinions from any of them from the People of the Scripture the Jews. The people of Mecca asked him the Prophet about the story of the People of the Cave and so he said to them ‘I will tell you about it tomorrow’ but without adding the words ‘If God wills’ inshā’a’ Llāhu and so the following was revealed
The Cave,18,23,"And say not of anything: Lo! I shall do that tomorrow,",And never say regarding something that is for the purpose of doing something ‘I will indeed do that tomorrow’ in other words I will do something at some future point in time
The Cave,18,24,"Except if Allah will. And remember thy Lord when thou forgettest, and say: It may be that my Lord guideth me unto a nearer way of truth than this.",without adding ‘If God will’ in other words unless firmly adhering to the will of God exalted be He by saying ‘If God will’ inshā’a’Llāh. And remember your Lord that is remember His will making things conditional on it if you forget to make things conditional on it mentioning it after forgetting it is the equal in validity to mentioning it at the time of the statement — as al-Hasan al-Basrī and others have said — as long as the person is still in the same place in which he made the statement. And say ‘May be my Lord will guide me to something closer in time than this closer than the story of the People of the Cave as an indication of the truth of my prophethood by way of guidance and God indeed did so.
The Cave,18,25,And (it is said) they tarried in their Cave three hundred years and add nine.,And they tarried in the Cave three hundred read with tanwīn thalāthami’atin years sinīn is an explicative supplement to thalāthami’atin ‘three hundred’ these three hundred years in the case of the People of the Cave were solar years; but for the number of lunar ones the Arabs add nine years thereto and this is mentioned in His saying and add nine that is nine years; in other words three hundred solar years while three hundred and nine lunar ones.
The Cave,18,26,"Say: Allah is Best Aware how long they tarried. His is the Invisible of the heavens and the earth. How clear of sight is He and keen of hearing! They have no protecting friend beside Him, and He maketh none to share in His government.",Say ‘God is more knowledgeable of how long they tarried more knowledgeable than those contending over this issue — and this fact has already been mentioned above verse 19. To Him belongs the Unseen of the heavens and the earth that is to Him belongs the knowledge thereof. How well He sees! namely God — this form is for expressing amazement at something. How well He hears! likewise for expressing amazement. These two expressions are being used metaphorically. What is meant is that nothing can escape God’s sight or hearing. They the inhabitants of the heavens and the earth have no guardian someone to assist them besides Him and He makes none to share in His rule’ for He is Independent without need of a partner.
The Cave,18,27,"And recite that which hath been revealed unto thee of the Scripture of thy Lord. There is none who can change His words, and thou wilt find no refuge beside Him.",And recite that which has been revealed to you of the Book of your Lord. There is none who can change His words. And you will not find besides Him any refuge.
The Cave,18,28,"Restrain thyself along with those who cry unto their Lord at morn and evening, seeking His Countenance; and let not thine eyes overlook them, desiring the pomp of the life of the world; and obey not him whose heart We have made heedless of Our remembrance, who followeth his own lust and whose case hath been abandoned.",And restrain yourself detain yourself along with those who call upon their Lord at morning and evening desiring through their worship His Countenance exalted be He and not any of the transient things of this world — and these are the poor; and do not let your eyes overlook turn away from them — these the eyes are being used to refer to the person addressed — desiring the glitter of the life of this world. And do not obey him whose heart We have made oblivious to Our remembrance that is to the Qur’ān — this was ‘Uyayna b. Hisn and his companions — and who follows his own whim by attributing partners to God and whose conduct is mere prodigality excess.
The Cave,18,29,"Say: (It is) the truth from the Lord of you (all). Then whosoever will, let him believe, and whosoever will, let him disbelieve. Lo! We have prepared for disbelievers Fire. Its tent encloseth them. If they ask for showers, they will be showered with water like to molten lead which burneth the faces. Calamitous the drink and ill the resting-place!",And say to him and to his companions that this Qur’ān is ‘The truth that comes from your Lord; so whoever will let him believe and whoever will let him disbelieve’ — this is meant as a threat to them. Indeed We have prepared for the wrongdoers that is the disbelievers a Fire and they will be surrounded by its pavilion by that which encloses the Fire itself. If they cry out for help they will be succoured with water like molten copper like thick burning oil which scalds faces because of the intensity of its heat if it is brought near them. What an evil drink that is and how ill is the Fire as a resting-place! murtafaqan is a specification derived from the agent of the verb in other words vile is the person choosing to rest thereon; and this is in contrast to what He will say next about Paradise How fair a resting-place below verse 31. For indeed what resting-place can there be in the Fire?
The Cave,18,30,Lo! as for those who believe and do good works - Lo! We suffer not the reward of one whose work is goodly to be lost.,Truly those who believe and perform righteous deeds — indeed We do not leave the reward of those of good deeds to go to waste this last sentence is the predicate of the previous inna’lladhīna ‘truly those who’ and in it an overt identification of the recipients of the reward has replaced the would-be pronominalisation in other words it is ‘their reward’ which shall not be left to go to waste and We will reward them with what it the reward of good-doers comprises.
The Cave,18,31,"As for such, theirs will be Gardens of Eden, wherein rivers flow beneath them; therein they will be given armlets of gold and will wear green robes of finest silk and gold embroidery, reclining upon throne therein. Blest the reward, and fair the resting-place!",Those for them there shall be Gardens of Eden as a place of residence underneath which rivers flow; therein they shall be adorned with bracelets of gold min asāwir it is said that min here is either extra or partitive; it asāwir is the plural of aswira — similar in pattern to ahmira for himār — which is the plural of siwār and they shall wear green garments of fine silk sundus and heavy silk brocade istabraq is that silk which is coarse God says in the verse of sūrat al-Rahmān Q. 5554 lined with heavy silk brocade; reclining therein on couches arā’ik is the plural of arīka which is a bed inside a curtained canopy and is also a tent adorned with garments and curtains for a bride. How excellent a reward a requital is Paradise and how fair a resting-place!
The Cave,18,32,"Coin for them a similitude: Two men, unto one of whom We had assigned two gardens of grapes, and We had surrounded both with date-palms and had put between them tillage.",And strike coin for them for the disbelievers together with the believers a similitude two men rajulayn is a substitute for mathalan ‘a similitude’ and constitutes together with what follows an explanation of the similitude to one of whom the disbeliever We had assigned two gardens orchards of vines and We had surrounded them with date-palms and had set between them a field of crops from which he acquired his food supplies.
The Cave,18,33,Each of the gardens gave its fruit and withheld naught thereof. And We caused a river to gush forth therein.,Each of the two gardens kiltā ‘each of the two’ is a singular noun that indicates a dual number; and the entire clause is the subject yielded ātat is the predicate thereof its produce its fruit without stinting diminishing anything thereof. And We caused a stream to gush forth therein to run through them.
The Cave,18,34,"And he had fruit. And he said unto his comrade, when he spake with him: I am more than thee in wealth, and stronger in respect of men.",And he had together with his two gardens fruit read thamar thumur or thumr all of which constitute the plural of thamra sing. ‘a fruit’ similar in pattern to shajara pl. shajar khashaba pl. khushb or badana pl. budn and he said to his companion the believer as he conversed with him boasting before him ‘I have more wealth than you and am stronger in respect of men’ in respect of clansmen.
The Cave,18,35,"And he went into his garden, while he (thus) wronged himself. He said: I think not that all this will ever perish.",And he entered his garden taking with him his companion accompanying him all around it showing him its fruits — God does not say here his ‘two gardens’ because what is meant is the beautiful part of the garden rawda; or because to mention just one suffices — having wronged himself through his disbelief. He said ‘I do not think that all this will ever perish become non-existent.
The Cave,18,36,"I think not that the Hour will ever come, and if indeed I am brought back unto my Lord I surely shall find better than this as a resort.",Moreover I do not think that the Hour will ever come; and even if I am indeed returned to my Lord in the Hereafter according to your claim I shall surely find better than this as a resort’ as a place of return.
The Cave,18,37,"His comrade, when he (thus) spake with him, exclaimed: Disbelievest thou in Him Who created thee of dust, then of a drop (of seed), and then fashioned thee a man ?",His companion said to him as he conversed with him responding to him ‘Do you disbelieve in Him Who created you of dust — as Adam was created of it — then of a drop of fluid of semen then fashioned you made you upright and gave you the form of a man?
The Cave,18,38,"But He is Allah, my Lord, and I ascribe unto my Lord no partner.",But lo lākinnā is actually made up of lākin anā ‘but I … ’ where the hamza vowel has either been transferred onto the nūn of lākin or omitted altogether with the nūn assimilated with the like of it He is huwa this is the pronoun of the subject matter to be stated and is clarified by the sentence that follows it the meaning in other words is ‘But it is that I say that He is’ God my Lord and I do not ascribe any partner to my Lord.
The Cave,18,39,"If only, when thou enteredst thy garden, thou hadst said: That which Allah willeth (will come to pass)! There is no strength save in Allah! Though thou seest me as less than thee in wealth and children,",And if only when you entered your garden you had said upon admiring it ‘This is “What God has willed. There is no power except in God”. In a hadīth it is stated that ‘Whoever is given something good in the way of family or wealth and upon receiving it says “What God wills comes to pass; there is no power except in God” mā shā’a’Llāh lā quwwata illā bi’Llāh he will never experience any ill therefrom’. If you see me anā is a pronoun separating two direct objects as less than you in wealth and children
The Cave,18,40,"Yet it may be that my Lord will give me better than thy garden, and will send on it a bolt from heaven, and some morning it will be a smooth hillside,",maybe my Lord will give me something better than your garden this is the response to the conditional clause beginning with lawlā ‘and if only’ and unleash upon it bolts husbān is the plural of husbāna that is to say thunderbolts from the heaven so that it becomes a bare plain a piece of smooth ground upon which no foot can stand firm;
The Cave,18,41,Or some morning the water thereof will be lost in the earth so that thou canst not make search for it.,or maybe its water will sink deep down ghawran functions in meaning like ghā’iran and it constitutes a supplement to yursila ‘He will unleash’ but not a supplement to tusbiha ‘it becomes’ because the sinking of water deep into the earth does not necessarily result from thunderbolts so that you have no means of acquiring it’ no possible way of reaching it.
The Cave,18,42,"And his fruit was beset (with destruction). Then began he to wring his hands for all that he had spent upon it, when (now) it was all ruined on its trellises, and to say: Would that I had ascribed no partner to my Lord!",And his fruit was beset through the curbing measures mentioned above it was beset together with his garden by destruction and were thus ruined and so he began to wring his hands out of regret and anguish because of what he had spent on it on the cultivation of his garden as it lay fallen having collapsed on its trellises those supporting the vines so that first these collapsed and then the vine-grapes collapsed after them saying ‘O yā is for exclamation I wish I had not ascribed any partner to my Lord!’
The Cave,18,43,"And he had no troop of men to help him as against Allah, nor could he save himself.",But there was no read takun or yakun party no persons to help him besides God at the moment of its destruction nor could he help himself at the moment of its destruction all by himself.
The Cave,18,44,"In this case is protection only from Allah, the True, He is Best for reward, and best for consequence.",There that is on the Day of Resurrection all protection walāya; if read wilāya then it means ‘sovereignty’ belongs to God the True if read as al-haqqu then it is as an adjective qualifying walāya or wilāya or if read as al-haqqi then it is an attribute of God’s Majesty. He is better at rewarding than the rewarding of any person other than Him if such a person were in a position to reward; and best in consequence read ‘uquban or ‘uqban He is best in terms of the consequence for believers both thawāban ‘rewarding’ and ‘uqban ‘consequence’ are in the accusative for the purpose of specification.
The Cave,18,45,"And coin for them the similitude of the life of the world as water which We send down from the sky, and the vegetation of the earth mingleth with it and then becometh dry twigs that the winds scatter. Allah is able to do all things.",And strike draw for them your people the similitude of the life of this world mathala’l-hayāti’l-dunyā constitutes the first direct object as water ka-mā’in the second direct object which We send down out from the heaven and the vegetation of the earth mingles with it the vegetation multiplies by the sending down of the water; or it is that the water mixes with the vegetation such that it is nourished and flourishes; and it then becomes the vegetation becomes chaff dried up its various parts broken up in fragments scattered strewn and dispersed by the winds which then blow it away.

The Cave,18,49,"And the Book is placed, and thou seest the guilty fearful of that which is therein, and they say: What kind of a Book is this that leaveth not a small thing nor a great thing but hath counted it!

The Cave,18,50,"And (remember) when We said unto the angels: Fall prostrate before Adam, and they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He was of the jinn, so he rebelled against his Lord’s command.

He was one of the jinn — some say that these creatures are a species of angels in which case the exceptive clause illā Iblīs ‘except Iblīs’ is a continuous one; but it is also said to be discontinuous since Iblīs is considered the progenitor of all the jinn having offspring who are mentioned alongside him further below; angels on the other hand do not have offspring; and he transgressed against his Lord’s command that is to say he rebelled against obedience to Him by refraining from performing the prostration. Will you then take him and his offspring — this address is to Adam and his progeny the final pronominal suffix hā’ in both words refers to Iblīs for your patrons instead of Me obeying them when they are an enemy to you? in other words when they are your enemies wa-hum lakum ‘aduwwun is a circumstantial qualifier. How evil for the evildoers is that substitute! of Iblīs and his offspring in obeying them instead of obeying God.

Nor do I take misleaders devils as My support as assistants in the process of creation so why do you obey them?
The Cave,18,52,"And (be mindful of) the Day when He will say: Call those partners of Mine whom ye pretended. Then they will cry unto them, but they will not hear their prayer, and We shall set a gulf of doom between them.",And the day yawma is in the accusative because it is governed by the implicit udhkur ‘mention’ when He will say yaqūl or it may be read as naqūl ‘We will say’ ‘Call those partners of Mine those graven images as you used to claim’ let them intercede for you in the way you used to claim; and then they will call them but they will not respond to their call they will not answer them and We shall set between them between the graven images and those who worship them a gulf of doom — a valley from among the valleys of Hell in which they shall all be destroyed the term mawbiq derives from the verb wabaqa meaning halaka ‘he was destroyed’.

And they take Our revelations and that wherewith they are threatened as a jest.,And We do not send messengers except as bearers of good tidings to believers and as warners as threateners to disbelievers. But those who disbelieve dispute with falsehood when they say that ‘Has God sent a human as a messenger from Him?’ Q. 1794 and the like of such statements that they may refute thereby that by way of their disputing they may invalidate the truth the Qur’ān.

Indeed on their hearts We have cast veils coverings lest they should understand it that is lest they should comprehend the Qur’ān in other words and so as a result they do not comprehend it; and in their ears a deafness a heaviness and so they do not hear it; and though you call them to guidance they will not be guided in that case that is given the casting of veils mentioned ever.

We destroyed them when they did wrong, and We appointed a fixed time for their destruction.",And those towns that is to say the inhabitants of those towns such as ‘Ād and Thamūd as well as others We destroyed them when they did evil when they disbelieved and We appointed for their destruction a variant reading for mahlikihim has muhlakihim a tryst.
The Cave,18,60,"And when Moses said unto his servant: I will not give up until I reach the point where the two rivers meet, though I march on for ages.",And mention when Moses son of Amram ‘Imrān said to his lad Joshua son of Nun Yūsha‘ bin Nūn who used to follow him around serve him and acquire knowledge from him ‘I will not give up I will not stop journeying until I have reached the juncture of the two seas — the point where the Byzantine sea and the Persian sea meet beyond the east — though I march on for ages’ for a very long time before reaching it if it be far.
The Cave,18,61,"And when they reached the point where the two met, they forgot their fish, and it took its way into the waters, being free.",So when they reached a juncture between the two between the two seas they forgot their fish — Joshua forgot his luggage leaving it behind at the moment of departure and Moses forgot to remind him — and so it the fish made its way into the sea that is it formed it — through God’s forming it — by burrowing that is like through a burrow which is a passage that is long and enclosed; this was so because God exalted be He held back the flow of the water preventing it from engulfing the fish and it the water withdrew from around it the fish and remained thus like a cleft without closing and what was beneath it the cleft stood still.
The Cave,18,62,"And when they had gone further, he said unto his servant: Bring us our breakfast. Verily we have found fatigue in this our journey.",And when they had made the traverse of that location having journeyed until the morning of the following day he Moses said to his lad ‘Bring us our breakfast ghadā’ that meal which is consumed at the beginning of the day. We have certainly encountered on this journey of ours much fatigue’ exhaustion which took its effect on them after the traverse.
The Cave,18,63,"He said: Didst thou see, when we took refuge on the rock, and I forgot the fish - and none but Satan caused me to forget to mention it - it took its way into the waters by a marvel.",He said ‘Do you see? — in other words remember when we sheltered at the rock in that location indeed I forgot the fish — and none but Satan made me forget al-shaytān ‘Satan’ substitutes for the suffixed pronoun hā’ of ansānī-hu to mention it an adhkurahu an inclusive substitution in other words it should be understood as ansānī dhikrahu ‘he Satan made me forget the mentioning of it’ — and it the fish made its way into the sea in an amazing manner’ ‘ajaban constitutes the second direct object that is to say Moses and his lad were amazed by it because of what has already been explained concerning it.
The Cave,18,64,He said: This is that which we have been seeking. So they retraced their steps again.,Said he Moses ‘That namely our losing the fish is what we have been seeking!’ what we have been after for it is a sign for us of the presence of the one whom we seek. So they turned back retracing their footsteps until they reached the rock.
The Cave,18,65,"Then found they one of Our slaves, unto whom We had given mercy from Us, and had taught him knowledge from Our presence.",So there they found one of Our servants namely al-Khidr to whom We had given mercy from Us — according to one opinion this mercy was prophethood; according to another it was authority and this latter is the opinion of the majority of scholars — and We had taught him knowledge from Us ‘ilman is the second direct object in other words some knowledge of unseen things; al-Bukhārī reports the following hadīth ‘Moses was delivering a sermon among the Children of Israel and was asked “Who is the most knowledgeable of people?” to which he Moses said “Myself”. God then reproached him for not having attributed his knowledge as coming from Him. God then revealed to him the following “Truly there is a servant of Mine at the juncture of the two seas; he is more knowledgeable than you”. Moses then asked “My Lord how do I reach him?” He God said ‘Take a fish with you and place it in a basket and the place where you lose the fish will be the place where he is.” He Moses took a fish and placed it in a basket and departed together with his lad Joshua son of Nun until they reached the rock. There they placed their heads back and fell asleep. The fish began to move about in the basket until it escaped from it and fell into the sea and it made its way into the sea in an amazing manner. God then held back the flow of the water preventing it from engulfing the fish forming a kind of arch over it. When he awoke his companion Joshua forgot to inform him of what had happened to the fish and so they journeyed on for the remainder of that day and night until on the morning of the second day Moses said to his lad ‘Bring us our breakfast’ to where he says and it made its way into the sea in an amazing manner’. He Bukhārī said ‘For the fish it the way into the sea was by ‘burrowing’ saraban and for Moses and his lad it this way was ‘amazing’ ‘ajaban …’ and so on to the end of Bukhārī’s report.
The Cave,18,66,"Moses said unto him: May I follow thee, to the end that thou mayst teach me right conduct of that which thou hast been taught ?",Moses said to him ‘May I follow you for the purpose that you teach me of what you have been taught in the way of probity?’ namely something of right conduct through which I might be rightly-guided a variant reading for rashadan has rushdan ‘probity’; he asked him this because to increase one’s knowledge is something which is always sought.
The Cave,18,67,He said: Lo! thou canst not bear with me.,Said he ‘Truly you will not be able to bear with me.
The Cave,18,68,How canst thou bear with that whereof thou canst not compass any knowledge ?,And how can you bear with that whereof you have never been informed?’ in the above-mentioned hadīth of Bukhārī after this verse there is the following statement ‘O Moses I possess knowledge which God has taught me and which you do not have and equally you possess knowledge which God has taught you and which I do not have’. His saying khubran ‘informed’ is a verbal noun meaning that which you have never encompassed in other words the truth of which you have never been informed of.
The Cave,18,69,"He said: Allah willing, thou shalt find me patient and I shall not in aught gainsay thee.",He said ‘You will find me God willing patient and I will not disobey in other words and you will also find me non-disobedient towards you in any matter’ with which you charge me. He Moses made this statement conditional upon the Will of God because he was not confident of himself in what he had committed himself to. Indeed this is the custom of prophets and saints namely that they do not put their trust in themselves for a single moment.
The Cave,18,70,"He said: Well, if thou go with me, ask me not concerning aught till I myself make mention of it unto thee.",He said ‘If you follow me then do not question me lā tas’alnī a variant reading has lā tas’alannī concerning anything that you might find objectionable in what I do according to your limited knowledge and be patient until I myself make mention of it to you’ in other words until I mention it to you with an explication of the reason for it.

The Cave,18,71,"So they twain set out till, when they were in the ship, he made a hole therein. (Moses) said: Hast thou made a hole therein to drown the folk thereof ? Thou verily hast done a dreadful thing.",So they set off making their way on foot along the coast of the sea until when they embarked on the ship which was carrying them he al-Khidr made a hole in it by destroying a plank or two on the starboard side with an axe after they had sailed into deep waters.

The Cave,18,73,"(Moses) said: Be not wroth with me that I forgot, and be not hard upon me for my fault.",He said ‘Do not take me to task on account of that which I forgot that is on account of the fact that I was not mindful of submitting to you in the matter and of refraining from showing disapproval of your actions and do not exhaust me do not charge me in this affair of mine with difficulty’ with hardship during my companionship of you in other words treat me throughout it with forgiveness and indulgence.
The Cave,18,74,"So they twain journeyed on till, when they met a lad, he slew him. (Moses) said: What! Hast thou slain an innocent soul who hath slain no man ? Verily thou hast done a horrid thing.",So they set off after leaving the ship making their way on foot until when they met a boy who had not yet reached puberty playing with other boys among whom his face was the fairest — and he al-Khidr slew him by slitting his throat with a knife while he lay down or by tearing his head off with his hand or by smashing his head against a wall all of which are different opinions the coordinating fā’ of fa-qatalahu ‘and he slew him’ is used here because it indicates that the slaying took place after the encounter; the response to idhā ‘when’ is the following statement qāla … — he Moses said to him ‘Have you slain an innocent soul that is a pure one that had not reached the age of legal responsibility a variant reading for zākiya has zakiyya one slain not in retaliation for another soul? in other words one that has not slain any soul. Verily you have committed an dreadful thing’ read nukran or nukuran that is to say an abomination.
The Cave,18,75,He said: Did I not tell thee that thou couldst not bear with me ?,He said ‘Did I not say to you that you would never be able to bear with me?’ laka ‘to you’ has been added to that same statement which was made before because this time there could not be any excuse for Moses’s impatience.
The Cave,18,76,"(Moses) said: If I ask thee after this concerning aught, keep not company with me. Thou hast received an excuse from me.",And for this reason he said ‘If I ask you about anything after this after this instance then do not keep me in your company do not allow me to follow you for truly you will have found from me read ladunnī or ladunī on my part sufficient enough excuse’ for you to part company with me.
The Cave,18,77,"So they twain journeyed on till, when they came unto the folk of a certain township, they asked its folk for food, but they refused to make them guests.

They then found in it a wall one hundred cubits high about to collapse that is it was close to falling down because of its tilt; so he al-Khidr straightened it with his own hands. He Moses said to him ‘Had you wished you could have taken a variant reading for la-ttakhadhta has la-takhidhta a wage for it’ some sort of payment since they did not extend us any hospitality despite our need for food.
The Cave,18,78,He said: This is the parting between thee and me! I will announce unto thee the interpretation of that thou couldst not bear with patience.,Said he al-Khidr to him ‘This is the parting that is the moment for parting between me and you baynī wa-baynika here the preposition bayna has been annexed to a non-multiple noun but this is allowed grammatically because it is then repeated with its other noun together with the coordinating wāw. I will inform you before I part company with you the interpretation of that over which you were not able to maintain patience.

The Cave,18,80,"And as for the lad, his parents were believers and we feared lest he should oppress them by rebellion and disbelief.",And as for the boy his parents were believers and We feared lest he should overwhelm them with insolence and disbelief — for he is as described by the hadīth of Muslim ‘He was incorrigibly disposed to disbelief and had he lived longer this disposition of his would have oppressed them because of their love for him they would have followed him in such a path of disbelief’.
The Cave,18,81,And we intended that their Lord should change him for them for one better in purity and nearer to mercy.,So We desired that their Lord should give them in exchange read yubaddilahumā or yubdilahumā one better than him in purity that is in righteousness and God-fearing and closer than him to mercy read ruhman or ruhuman in other words it is to be understood as rahmatan ‘by way of mercy’ namely closer to dutifulness towards his parents.

And I did not do it namely what has been mentioned of his making a hole in the ship the slaying of the boy and the repair of the wall of my own accord that is out of my own choosing; nay it was because of a command in the form of an inspiration from God. This is the interpretation of that over which you could not maintain patience’ one may say istā‘a or istatā‘a to mean ‘he had the capacity for something’; in this instance and the previous one both forms of the verb have been used.

Mary,19,21,"He said: So (it will be). Thy Lord saith: It is easy for Me. And (it will be) that We may make of him a revelation for mankind and a mercy from Us, and it is a thing ordained.",He said ‘It the matter in question of creating a boy from you without a father shall be so! Your Lord has said “It is easy for Me in other words by Gabriel’s breathing into you by My command so that you become pregnant with him — since what has been mentioned is meant as a reason the following statement is added as a supplement thereto and so that We may make him a sign for mankind of Our power and a mercy from Us to whoever believes in him.

Mary,19,26,"So eat and drink and be consoled. And if thou meetest any mortal, say: Lo! I have vowed a fast unto the Beneficent, and may not speak this day to any mortal.",So eat of the dates and drink from the rivulet and let your eye be comforted by the child ‘aynan ‘your eye’ a specification derived from the subject of the verb in other words what is meant is li-taqarra ‘aynuki bihi ‘that your eye may be comforted by him’ that is let it your eye be at peace and not covet any other than him; and if immā the nūn of the conditional particle in is here assimilated with the extra mā you happen to see tarayinna the third consonantal root the yā’ and the second the hamza have been omitted with the fatha vowel therein transferred to the first consonant the letter rā’ and a kasra vowel applied to the yā’ of the feminine person because of two unvowelled consonants coming together any human being and should he ask you about your child then say “I have vowed to the Compassionate One a fast that is to say an abstention from speaking of his affair and from speaking to any other humans — which is indicated by the following statement so I will not speak to any human today”’ that is after saying this.

When He decreeth a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is.",It is not befitting for God to take to Himself a son. Glory be to Him — in affirmation of His being transcendent above doing such a thing.

So worship Him read the introductory particle as anna with an implicit preceding udhkur ‘mention’; or read it as inna with an implicit preceding qul ‘say’ a reading indicated by the fact that God says elsewhere ‘I only said to them that which You commanded me “Worship God my Lord and your Lord” ’ Q. 5117.

Mary,19,38,See and hear them on the Day they come unto Us! yet the evil-doers are to-day in error manifest.,How hearing they are and seeing they are these two constructions are used to express ‘amazement’ meaning ‘how well they will hear and how well they will see’ on the Day when they come to Us in the Hereafter. Yet the evildoers an example of a proper noun ‘evildoers’ replacing a third person pronominalisation today that is in this world are in manifest error that is error that is evident therein having been deaf unable to listen to the truth and blind unable to see it. In other words the meaning is O you the one being addressed marvel at how well they will be able to hear and see in the Hereafter after they had been deaf and blind in this world.

Why worshippest thou that which heareth not nor seeth, nor can in aught avail thee ?",When he said to his father Āzar ‘O my father! the final tā’ here of abati has replaced the possessive yā’ of genitive annexation sc. of yā abī; the two however are never used together — he Abraham’s father used to worship idols. Why do you worship that which neither hears nor sees and is of no avail to you suffices you not in any way? whether in terms of benefit or harm.

Truly He is ever gracious to me hafiyyan from hafiyyun meaning bārrun ‘kind’ answering my prayers. And indeed he Abraham fulfilled his above-mentioned promise as described in sūrat al-Shu‘arā’ And forgive my father Q. 2686; but this was before it became clear to him that he Abraham’s father was an enemy of God as mentioned in sūrat Barā’a Q. 9114.
Mary,19,48,"I shall withdraw from you and that unto which ye pray beside Allah, and I shall pray unto my Lord.

I will supplicate I will worship my Lord — hopefully in calling upon in worshipping my Lord I shall not be wretched’ as you have become wretched by your worship of idols.
Mary,19,49,"So, when he had withdrawn from them and that which they were worshipping beside Allah, We gave him Isaac and Jacob. Each of them We made a prophet.",And so after he had shunned them and that which they worshipped besides God by having set off to the Holy Land We gave him two sons for him to find solace in Isaac and Jacob and each of the two We made a prophet.

Indeed he was devoted to God read either as mukhlisan to mean ‘one sincerely devoted to worship of God’; or read mukhlasan to mean ‘he was delivered’ as in God had delivered him from defilement and he was a messenger a prophet.
Mary,19,52,"We called him from the right slope of the Mount, and brought him nigh in communion.",And We called him — with the words ‘O Moses! Verily I am God’ Q. 279 — from the right side of the Mount al-Tūr is actually the name of a mountain that is from the side to the right of Moses as he was approaching the Mount from Midian; and We brought him near in communion as God exalted be He made him hear His speech.
Mary,19,53,"And We bestowed upon him of Our mercy his brother Aaron, a prophet (likewise).",And We gave him out of Our mercy Our grace his brother Aaron Hārūn either a substitution for akhāhu ‘his brother’ or an explicative supplement thereof likewise a prophet nabiyyan a circumstantial qualifier constituting the import of the ‘gift’ to Moses which was in response to his Moses’s request that He God send forth his brother with him; he Aaron was older in years than him.

Mary,19,58,"These are they unto whom Allah showed favour from among the prophets, of the seed of Adam and of those whom We carried (in the ship) with Noah, and of the seed of Abraham and Israel, and from among those whom We guided and chose. When the revelations of the Beneficent were recited unto them, they fell down, adoring and weeping.",Those ūlā’ika is the subject to whom God has been gracious alladhīna an‘ama’Llāhu ‘alayhim is an adjectival qualification of it of the subject from among the prophets mina’l-nabīyyīna an explication of it of the subject functioning like an adjectival qualification in terms of import. That which follows it mina’l-nabīyyīna ‘from among the prophets’ up to where the conditional sentence begins constitutes an adjectival qualification of al-nabīyyīna ‘the prophets’; and so His saying … of the seed of Adam namely Idrīs and of those whom We carried with Noah in the Ark namely Abraham — who is the son of his Noah’s son Shem Sām — and of the seed of Abraham namely Ishmael Isaac and Jacob and of the seed of Israel — who is Jacob — namely Moses Aaron Zachariah John and Jesus and from among those whom We guided and chose that is to say from among their number the predicate of ūlā’ika ‘those’ is the following idhā tutlā … when the signs of the Compassionate One were recited to them they would fall down prostrating and weeping these sujjadan and bukīyyan constitute the plural forms of sājid ‘prostrate’ and bākin ‘weeping’ respectively in other words what is meant is be you like them bukiyyun is originally formed from bakūyyin but the wāw is changed into a yā’ and the damma vowel into a kasra.
Mary,19,59,Now there hath succeeded them a later generation whom have ruined worship and have followed lusts. But they will meet deception.,But there succeeded after them a posterity who neglected the prayer by abandoning performance of it a posterity such as the Jews and the Christians and followed their lusts in the way of acts of disobedience. So they shall soon encounter Ghayy — a valley in Hell — that is they shall fall into it;

His promise is ever sure of fulfilment -",they shall enter Gardens of Eden as a place of residence jannāti ‘Adnin substitutes for al-janna ‘Paradise’ which the Compassionate One has promised to His servants a promise in the Unseen bi’l-ghaybi a circumstantial qualifier in other words a promise made while they do not see it. Indeed His promise that is to say that which He promises is ever fulfilled meaning that it always arrives the original form of ma’tiyyan is ma’tūyun; or what is meant by His promise here is Paradise to which those deserving of it shall arrive.
Mary,19,62,"They hear therein no idle talk, but only Peace; and therein they have food for morn and evening.",Therein they shall not hear anything that is trifling of talk but they shall hear only a greeting of ‘Peace!’ from the angels to them or from some among them to others.

Mary,19,63,Such is the Garden which We cause the devout among Our bondmen to inherit.,That is the Paradise which We shall give as inheritance which We shall grant and in which We shall lodge those of Our servants who are God-fearing through their obedience of Him.
Mary,19,64,"We (angels) come not down save by commandment of thy Lord. Unto Him belongeth all that is before us and all that is behind us and all that is between those two, and thy Lord was never forgetful -",When the Revelation did not come for a number of days the Prophet s said to Gabriel ‘What prevents you from visiting us more often than you do?’ and so the following was revealed And We do not descend except by the commandment of your Lord. To Him belongs all that is before us namely ahead of us of the affairs of the Hereafter and all that is behind us of the affairs of this world and all that is between those two namely all that takes place from this point in time until the coming of the Hour in other words to Him belongs knowledge of all of those things. And your Lord is never forgetful meaning that He is never neglectful of you even when the Revelation is postponed from being sent to you.

Mary,19,66,"And man saith: When I am dead, shall I forsooth be brought forth alive ?",And man the denier of the Resurrection — namely Ubayy b. Khalaf or al-Walīd b. al-Mughīra concerning whom the verse was revealed — says ‘When read a-idha either pronouncing the second hamza or not but inserting an alif between the two hamzas in both readings I am dead shall I then be brought forth alive?’ from the grave as Muhammad (s) says? the interrogative here statement is meant as a denial in other words he means to say I shall not be brought forth alive after death; mā of mā mittu ‘I am dead’ is extra for emphasis likewise extra is the lām of la-sawfa ‘shall I then’. He God then responds to him with the following saying of His exalted be He
Mary,19,67,"Doth not man remember that We created him before, when he was naught ?",Does not man then remember yadhdhakaru is actually yatadhakkaru but the tā’ has been changed to a dhāl and assimilated with the other dhāl; a variant reading leaves it as yadhkuru that We created him before when he was nothing? and thus infer from the first act of creation the possibility of resurrection.
Mary,19,68,"And, by thy Lord, verily We shall assemble them and the devils, then We shall bring them, crouching, around hell.",For by your Lord We will surely gather them namely the deniers of the Resurrection and the devils that is to say We shall gather every one of them with his devil bound together in a chain; then We shall bring them around Hell around the outside of it crouching on their knees jithiyyan is the plural of jāthin and is originally formed as jathawuwwin or jathawiyyun deriving from the verb jathā imperfect tense yajthu or yajthī two variant forms.
Mary,19,69,Then We shall pluck out from every sect whichever of them was most stubborn in rebellion to the Beneficent.,Then We shall pluck out from every party every sect whichever of them was most hardened in disdain in insolence of the Compassionate One.
Mary,19,70,And surely We are Best Aware of those most worthy to be burned therein.,Then indeed We shall know best those most deserving of it most worthy of being in Hell the most hardened of them and others like them for the burning for the admission into it and the scorching therein and We shall start with them siliyyan is originally formed as salawiyyun from the verb saliya or salaya.
Mary,19,71,There is not one of you but shall approach it. That is a fixed ordinance of thy Lord.,There is not one of you but shall come to it that is but shall enter Hell. That is an inevitability already decreed by your Lord something which He made inevitable and which He decreed; He will not waive it.
Mary,19,72,"Then We shall rescue those who kept from evil, and leave the evil- doers crouching there.",Then We will deliver read nunajjī or nunjī those who were wary of committing idolatry or disbelief We will deliver them from it and leave those who did wrong by way of idolatry and disbelief crouching therein on their knees.
Mary,19,73,"And when Our clear revelations are recited unto them, those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Which of the two parties (yours or ours) is better in position, and more imposing as an army ?",And when Our manifest evident bayyinātin ‘manifest’ is a circumstantial qualifier signs in the Qur’ān are recited to them namely to the believers and the disbelievers those who disbelieve say to those who believe ‘Which of the two parties — us or you — is better in station in lodging and abode read as maqāman it is derived from the first form qāma ‘he stood’; read as muqāman it is derived from the fourth form aqāma ‘he took up residence’ and more excellent in assembly?’ nadiyyan meaning the place in which a folk assemble and converse. They the disbelievers mean ‘we are the better of the two parties’ and so we will fare better than you. God exalted be He says
Mary,19,74,"How many a generation have We destroyed before them, who were more imposing in respect of gear and outward seeming!",And how many — in other words many — a generation that is a community from among the communities of the past have We destroyed before them who were superior in their possession of gear in wealth and chattel and in appearance superior as a sight ri’yan derives from the infinitive al-ru’ya. Thus in the same way that We destroyed those ones because of their disbelief We will destroy these ones also.
Mary,19,75,"Say: As for him who is in error, the Beneficent will verily prolong his span of life until, when they behold that which they were promised, whether it be punishment (in the world), or the Hour (of doom), they will know who is worse in position and who is weaker as an army.",Say ‘As for him who is in error man kāna fī’l-dalālati a conditional clause the response to which is fa’l-yamdud ‘He shall prolong’ and what follows it the Compassionate One shall defer fa’l-yamdud functions in the sense of a predicate him from chastisement by granting him some respite in this world drawing him on to his eventual chastisement gradually until when they catch sight of that which they were promised whether it be chastisement in this world by being killed or taken captive or the Hour the Resurrection that comprises Hell they will enter it. Then they will surely know who is worse in respect of position and weaker in respect of the number of hosts’ in respect of the number of supporters themselves or the believers? Their hosts will be the devils while the hosts of the believers against them will be the angels.
Mary,19,76,"Allah increaseth in right guidance those who walk aright, and the good deeds which endure are better in thy Lord’s sight for reward, and better for resort.",And God increases in guidance those who found right guidance through faith increasing them by way of the signs He reveals to them; and the enduring things the righteous deeds — namely obedience the reward of which endures for that person — are better in your Lord’s sight in terms of reward and better in terms of the return that is as something which will be repaid and returned to him the believer in contrast to the deeds of the disbelievers. The use of the qualification khayr ‘better’ here is meant to counter the use of the same in their statement ‘Which of the two parties is better in station?’ above Q. 1973.
Mary,19,77,Hast thou seen him who disbelieveth in Our revelations and saith: Assuredly I shall be given wealth and children ?,Have you seen him who disbelieves in Our signs namely al-‘Ās b. Wā’il and says to Khabbāb b. al-Aratt — who had said to him ‘You will be resurrected after death!’ and who had requested from him repayment of money — ‘I shall assuredly be given on the supposition that there is such a thing as resurrection wealth and children?’ and so I will repay you then. God exalted be He says

Tâ Hâ,20,72,"They said: We choose thee not above the clear proofs that have come unto us, and above Him Who created us. So decree what thou wilt decree. Thou wilt end for us only this life of the world.",They said ‘We will not choose you over what has come to us of clear signs proving the truthfulness of Moses and over Him Who originated us created us wa’lladhī fatarana either an oath or a supplement to the preceding mā ‘what’. Decree what you will decree that is do what you say. What you decree is only relevant in the life of this world al-hayāta’l-dunyā is in the accusative because the scope of his decree is being indicated in other words ‘you can only decree in it’; yet you will be requited for it in the Hereafter.
Tâ Hâ,20,73,"Lo! we believe in our Lord, that He may forgive us our sins and the magic unto which thou didst force us. Allah is better and more lasting.",Indeed We profess belief in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins in the way of ascribing partners to God and otherwise and the sorcery to which you forced us to learn and to perform in order to oppose Moses. And God is better than you in rewarding if he is obeyed and more enduring’ than you in chastisement if he is disobeyed.

That is the reward of him who groweth.",the Gardens of Eden that is to say as a place of residence this jannātu ‘Adnin ‘Gardens of Eden’ is an explication thereof of al-darajātu’l-‘ulā ‘the highest degrees’ underneath which rivers flow abiding therein and that is the reward of him who keeps pure of sins.
Tâ Hâ,20,77,"And verily We inspired Moses, saying: Take away My slaves by night and strike for them a dry path in the sea, fearing not to be overtaken, neither being afraid (of the sea).",And verily We revealed to Moses saying ‘Lead My servants on a journey by night read as an asri ‘that lead on a journey by night’ from fourth form asrā ‘he travelled by night’; or read as an’isri from first form sarā ‘he travelled by night’ both being alternative forms in other words travel with them by night from the land of Egypt and strike for them make for them by striking your staff a dry path in the sea. So he fulfilled what he had been commanded and God made the ground dry so that they were able to pass through it. Do not fear to be overtaken that is fearing that Pharaoh might catch you and do not be afraid’ of drowning.
Tâ Hâ,20,78,Then Pharaoh followed them with his hosts and there covered them that which did cover them of the sea.,Then Pharaoh pursued them with his hosts with him Pharaoh alongside them and there engulfed them what did engulf them of the sea and it drowned them.
Tâ Hâ,20,79,"And Pharaoh led his folk astray, he did not guide them.",And Pharaoh led his people astray by calling them to worship him and he did not guide them nay he led them to destruction in contrast to what he said to them and I guide you only to the path of rectitude Q. 4029.
Tâ Hâ,20,80,"O Children of Israel! We delivered you from your enemy, and we made a covenant with you on the holy mountain’s side, and sent down on you the manna and the quails,",O Children of Israel truly We delivered you from your enemy Pharaoh by drowning him and We made a tryst with you on the right side of the Tūr Mount in order to give Moses the Torah that it may be implemented it by you and We sent down to you manna and quails namely turunjabīn citrus fruit and the quail. The ones being addressed in the vocative by ‘O Children of Israel’ are those Jews living at the time of the Prophet s and they are addressed with reference to the graces which God bestowed on their forefathers at the time of the prophet Moses as a preface to what God now says to them
Tâ Hâ,20,81,"(Saying): Eat of the good things wherewith We have provided you, and transgress not in respect thereof lest My wrath come upon you: and he on whom My wrath cometh, he is lost indeed.",‘Eat of the good things We have provided you that is to say of that which has been bestowed on you as a grace from God but do not transgress regarding it by being ungrateful for the grace thereof lest My wrath descend on you if read fa-yahilla it means ‘lest it My wrath become incumbent upon you’; or if read fa-yuhilla it means ‘lest it descend on you’. And he on whom My wrath descends read yahlil ‘becomes incumbent’ or yahlul ‘descends’ certainly perishes falls into the Fire.
Tâ Hâ,20,82,"And lo! verily I am Forgiving toward him who repenteth and believeth and doeth good, and afterward walketh aright.",And indeed I am Forgiving toward him who repents from ascribing partners to God and believes affirms God’s Oneness and acts righteously is sincere in performing the obligatory and the supererogatory deeds and then follows guidance’ by adhering to what has been mentioned up to his death.
Tâ Hâ,20,83,"And (it was said): What hath made thee hasten from thy folk, O Moses ?",‘And what has hurried you to depart from your people in order to come to the appointed time to receive the Torah O Moses?’
Tâ Hâ,20,84,"He said: They are close upon my track. I hastened unto Thee, my Lord, that Thou mightest be well pleased.",He said ‘They are close behind me coming upon my track and I hastened to You my Lord that You may be pleased’ with me in other words to please you even more — before giving the response he gives an excuse according to what he supposed was the situation with his people
Tâ Hâ,20,85,"He said: Lo! We have tried thy folk in thine absence, and As- Samiri hath misled them.",But those he supposed to be following him had remained behind for He exalted be He said ‘Indeed We tried your people after you that is after your departure from them and the Samaritan led them astray’ so they took to worshipping the golden calf.
Tâ Hâ,20,86,"Then Moses went back unto his folk, angry and sad. He said: O my people! Hath not your Lord promised you a fair promise ? Did the time appointed then appear too long for you, or did ye wish that wrath from your Lord should come upon you, that ye broke tryst with me ?",Thereupon Moses returned to his people angry with them and sad extremely grieved. He said ‘O my people did not your Lord promise you a fair promise? that is a true promise that He will give you the Torah? Did the period the length of my absence from you seem too long for you or did you desire that wrath should become incumbent against you from your Lord by your worship of the golden calf and so you broke your tryst with me?’ and failed to follow after me?
Tâ Hâ,20,87,"They said: We broke not tryst with thee of our own will, but we were laden with burdens of ornaments of the folk, then cast them (in the fire), for thus As-Samiri proposed.",They said ‘We did not break our tryst with you of our own accord read the mīm with any of the three vowellings meaning ‘by our own power’ or ‘of our own will’ but we were laden with read hamalnā ‘we carried’ or hummilnā ‘we were made to carry’ the burdens the weight of the people’s ornaments of the trinkets of Pharaoh’s folk — which the Children of Israel had borrowed from them on the pretext of using them for a wedding but which had remained with them — and we cast them we threw them into the fire at the command of the Samaritan and so just as We cast did the Samaritan cast what he had on him of their trinkets together with the dust that he took from the track left by the hoof of Gabriel’s steed as follows
Tâ Hâ,20,88,"Then he produced for them a calf, of saffron hue, which gave forth a lowing sound. And they cried: This is your god and the god of Moses, but he hath forgotten.",Then he produced for them a calf which he fashioned from the melted trinkets — a mere body of flesh and blood with a low in other words it made a sound that was audible; it was transformed into such a state because of the dust from Gabriel’s steed the effect of which is to create life in whatever thing it is placed. After he had fashioned it he placed it the dust in its mouth. And they namely the Samaritan and his followers said ‘This is your God and the God of Moses so he Moses forgot’ his Lord here and set off in search of him. God exalted be He says
Tâ Hâ,20,89,"See they not, then, that it returneth no saying unto them and possesseth for them neither hurt nor use ?",Did they not see that in allā an has been softened in place of the hardened form with its subject omitted in other words it should be annahu it the Calf did not reciprocate their words that is that it did not give them any response in return nor did it have any power over hurt for them that is any power to prevent it or any benefit? that is any power to procure it for them in other words how can such a thing be taken as a god?
Tâ Hâ,20,90,"And Aaron indeed had told them beforehand: O my people! Ye are but being seduced therewith, for lo! your Lord is the Beneficent, so follow me and obey my order.",And Aaron had certainly said to them beforehand that is before the return of Moses ‘O my people you are only being tested thereby! But truly your Lord is the Compassionate One so follow me in worship of Him and obey my command’ therein.
Tâ Hâ,20,91,They said: We shall by no means cease to be its votaries till Moses return unto us.,They said ‘We will not cease to cling to it persisting in worship of it until Moses returns to us’.
Tâ Hâ,20,92,"He (Moses) said: O Aaron! What held thee back when thou didst see them gone astray,",He Moses said upon his return ‘O Aaron what held you back when you saw them going astray by worshipping it
Tâ Hâ,20,93,That thou followedst me not ? Hast thou then disobeyed my order ?,that allā read an instead the lā being extra you did not follow me? Did you then disobey my command?’ by remaining among those who worship something other than God exalted be He?
Tâ Hâ,20,94,"He said: O son of my mother! Clutch not my beard nor my head! I feared lest thou shouldst say: Thou hast caused division among the Children of Israel, and hast not waited for my word.",He Aaron said ‘O son of my mother read ya’bna’ummi or ya’bna’umma meaning ummī ‘my mother’ the mention of her is more effective in provoking the affection of his heart — do not clutch my beard which he had seized with his left hand or my head! for he had seized his hair with his right hand in anger. Indeed I feared that if I followed you for inevitably a group of those who did not worship the calf would have followed me you would have said “You have caused division among the Children of Israel — and have been furious with me — and you did not wait for my word”’ concerning what my opinion would have been in this matter.
Tâ Hâ,20,95,"(Moses) said: And what hast thou to say, O Samiri ?",He said ‘And what have you to say what was the motive for doing what you did O Samaritan?’
Tâ Hâ,20,96,"He said: I perceived what they perceive not, so I seized a handful from the footsteps of the messenger, and then threw it in. Thus my soul commended to me.",He said ‘I perceived what they did not perceive read either as third person plural yabsurū or as second person plural tabsurū ‘what you did not perceive’ in other words I realised what they did not realise so I seized a handful of dust from the track of from the hoof of the steed of the messenger Gabriel and threw it in I cast it onto the figure of the calf that had been fashioned. Thus my soul prompted thus it adorned for me’ and it was cast into me the idea that I seize a handful of the dust from that mentioned hoof and cast it onto what possessed no spirit so that it might thus acquire a spirit. I had seen that your people had asked that you make for them a god and so my soul suggested to me the idea that this calf should be their god.
Tâ Hâ,20,97,(Moses) said: Then go! and lo! in this life it is for thee to say: Touch me not! and lo! there is for thee a tryst thou canst not break. Now look upon thy god of which thou hast remained a votary. Verily we will burn it and will scatter its dust over the sea.,Said he Moses to him ‘Begone! It shall be yours as your lot throughout life that is for the duration of your life to say to whomever you may see “Do not touch me!” that is do not come near me — he used to wander about aimlessly throughout the land and whenever he touched a person or a person touched him both would succumb to a fever. And indeed there will be a tryst for you for you to be chastised which you will not fail to keep read lan tukhlifahu meaning ‘a tryst which you shall not miss’; or lan tukhlafahu ‘for which you will not be forgotten’ meaning ‘nay you will be sent forth to keep it’. Now look at your god to whom you remained clinging! zalta is actually zalilta but the first lām has been omitted in order to soften it that is to say you remained by his your god’s side worshipping him. We will surely burn it in fire and then scatter the ashes of it into the waters we will disperse it into the winds of the sea; and after having slaughtered it Moses did exactly that which he has mentioned.
Tâ Hâ,20,98,"Your God is only Allah, than Whom there is no other God. He embraceth all things in His knowledge.",Indeed your God is the One God than whom there is no other god. He embraces all things in His knowledge’ ‘ilman a specification derived from the subject of the verb in other words it means ‘His knowledge embraces all things’.
Tâ Hâ,20,99,"Thus relate We unto thee (Muhammad) some tidings of that which happened of old, and We have given thee from Our presence a reminder.",Thus just as We have related to you O Muhammad (s) this story We relate to you some stories some accounts of what is past of communities and We have given you from Ourselves a Reminder a Qur’ān.
Tâ Hâ,20,100,"Whoso turneth away from it, he verily will bear a burden on the Day of Resurrection,",Whoever turns away from it and does not believe in it he shall indeed on the Day of Resurrection bear a burden a heavy load of sin;
Tâ Hâ,20,101,"Abiding under it - an evil burden for them on the Day of Resurrection,",therein that is in the chastisement for such sin abiding. And evil for them on the Day of Resurrection is that burden! himlan a specification qualifying the person of the verb sā’a ‘evil’; the subject of derision the implied wizruhum ‘their sin’ has been omitted; the lām of lahum is explicative and substitutes for yawma’l-qiyāma ‘the Day of Resurrection.
Tâ Hâ,20,102,"The day when the Trumpet is blown. On that day we assemble the guilty white-eyed (with terror),",The day the Trumpet is blown the Horn the Second Blast and We shall assemble the criminals the disbelievers on that day bruised in the eye along with their faces blackened.
Tâ Hâ,20,103,Murmuring among themselves: Ye have tarried but ten (days).,They will whisper to one another speaking secretly amongst themselves ‘You have tarried in this world only ten nights’ with the full ten days.
Tâ Hâ,20,104,We are Best Aware of what they utter when their best in conduct say: Ye have tarried but a day.,We know very well what they will say regarding this matter — that is it is not as they say — when the justest the most upright of them in the way in this will say ‘You have tarried only a day’ they will deem their stay in this world as having been very brief on account of the terrors they will witness in the Hereafter.
Tâ Hâ,20,105,They will ask thee of the mountains (on that day). Say: My Lord will break them into scattered dust.,They will question you concerning the mountains how will they be on the Day of Resurrection? Say to them ‘My Lord will scatter them as ashes by pulverising them into moving sand and dispersing them with the wind;
Tâ Hâ,20,106,"And leave it as an empty plain,",then He will leave them a level hollow a flattened level surface
Tâ Hâ,20,107,Wherein thou seest neither curve nor ruggedness.,wherein you will see neither crookedness neither slope nor any curving’ nor any rise.
Tâ Hâ,20,108,"On that day they follow the summoner who deceiveth not, and voices are hushed for the Beneficent, and thou hearest but a faint murmur.",On that day that is on the day the mountains are scattered as ashes they will follow that is mankind will follow after rising from their graves the Summoner to the Gathering by the call of his voice — this Summoner will be the archangel Isrāfīl and he will say ‘Forward to the parade before God!’ — there will be no deviation therein that is in the manner in which they follow him in other words they cannot but follow him. Voices will be hushed will become silent before the Compassionate One so that you hear nothing but a faint shuffle the light tread of feet walking towards the Gathering similar to the sound of the hoofs of camels as they pass.
Tâ Hâ,20,109,On that day no intercession availeth save (that of) him unto whom the Beneficent hath given leave and whose word He accepteth.,On that day intercession will not profit anyone except intercession from him whom the Compassionate One permits that he intercede for such a person and whose word He approves that is to say because such an intercessor will say ‘there is no god but God’ lā ilāha illā’Llāh.
Tâ Hâ,20,110,"He knoweth (all) that is before them and (all) that is behind them, while they cannot compass it in knowledge.",He knows what is before them of the affairs of the Hereafter and behind them of the affairs of this world and they do not comprehend such things in knowledge they have no knowledge of such things.
Tâ Hâ,20,111,"And faces humble themselves before the Living, the Eternal. And he who beareth (a burden of) wrongdoing is indeed a failure (on that day).",And faces shall be humbled they shall be submissive before the Living the Eternal Sustainer namely God; and he will certainly have failed he will have lost he who carries the burden of evildoing that is of idolatry.
Tâ Hâ,20,112,"And he who hath done some good works, being a believer, he feareth not injustice nor begrudging (of his wage).",But whoever does righteous deeds acts of obedience being a believer shall fear neither wrong by having his evil deeds increased nor injustice by having his good deeds diminished.
Tâ Hâ,20,113,"Thus we have revealed it as a Lecture in Arabic, and have displayed therein certain threats, that peradventure they may keep from evil or that it may cause them to take heed.",Thus kadhālika a supplement to the previous kadhālika naqussu ‘thus We relate’ Q. 2099 just as We have revealed what has been mentioned We have revealed it that is the Qur’ān as an Arabic Qur’ān and We have distributed We have repeated in it statements of threats so that they may fear associating others with God or it the Qur’ān may arouse in them a remembrance of the destruction of those communities before and may thus be admonished.
Tâ Hâ,20,114,"Then exalted be Allah, the True King! And hasten not (O Muhammad) with the Qur’an ere its revelation hath been perfected unto thee, and say: My Lord! Increase me in knowledge.",So exalted be God the King the Truth above what the idolaters say. And do not hasten with the Qur’ān that is to recite it before its revelation is completed for you before Gabriel is through delivering it and say ‘My Lord increase me in knowledge’ that is knowledge of the Qur’ān thus every time something of it was revealed to him his knowledge increased because of it.
Tâ Hâ,20,115,"And verily We made a covenant of old with Adam, but he forgot, and We found no constancy in him.",And We made a covenant with Adam We enjoined him not to eat of the tree before that is before he ate of it but he forgot he disregarded Our covenant and We did not find in him any constancy any resoluteness or patience in abiding by what We forbade him from.
Tâ Hâ,20,116,"And when We said unto the angels: Fall prostrate before Adam, they fell prostrate (all) save Iblis; he refused.",And mention when We said to the angels ‘Prostrate before Adam’; so they prostrated except Iblīs who was the father of the jinn — he used to keep company with the angels and worship God alongside them he refused to prostrate before Adam he said ‘I am better than him’ Q. 712.
Tâ Hâ,20,117,"Therefor we said: O Adam! This is an enemy unto thee and unto thy wife, so let him not drive you both out of the Garden so that thou come to toil.",Then We said ‘Adam indeed this is an enemy of yours and of your wife Eve read Hawwā’. So do not let him cause you both to be expelled from the Garden so that you then toil so that you then become fatigued by the toil of tillage sowing harvesting milling baking and otherwise — the statement is restricted to the mention of his Adam’s ‘toil’ because it is the man who has to strive to provide for his wife.
Tâ Hâ,20,118,"It is (vouchsafed) unto thee that thou hungerest not therein nor art naked,",It is indeed assured for you that you will neither be hungry therein nor go naked
Tâ Hâ,20,119,And that thou thirstest not therein nor art exposed to the sun’s heat.,And it is indeed assured for you read wa-annaka or wa-innaka as a supplement to the subject of inna sc. laka that is ‘you’ and its clause neither to be thirsty therein nor to suffer the sun’ you will not be exposed to any heat of a midday sun for there is no sun in Paradise.
Tâ Hâ,20,120,"But the devil whispered to him, saying: O Adam! Shall I show thee the tree of immortality and power that wasteth not away ?",Then Satan whispered to him saying ‘O Adam shall I guide you to the Tree of Immortality which gives everlasting life to the one who eats thereof and a kingdom that does not waste away?’ that does not perish while he remains immortal.
Tâ Hâ,20,121,"Then they twain ate thereof, so that their shame became apparent unto them, and they began to hide by heaping on themselves some of the leaves of the Garden. And Adam disobeyed his Lord, so went astray.",So both of them Adam and Eve ate of it and their shameful parts were exposed to them that is the front private part of each became visible to the other as well as the other’s behind — both of these parts are called saw’a ‘shame’ because its exposure ‘shames’ yasū’u that person; and they began to piece together they took to sticking onto themselves leaves of the Garden to cover themselves up therewith. And Adam disobeyed his Lord and so he erred by his eating from the tree.
Tâ Hâ,20,122,"Then his Lord chose him, and relented toward him, and guided him.",Thereafter his Lord chose him He brought him close to Him and relented to him He accepted his repentance and guided him that is He guided him to seek repentance regularly.

But when there come unto you from Me a guidance, then whoso followeth My guidance, he will not go astray nor come to grief.",He said ‘Go down both of you that is Adam and Eve including all of your progeny from it from the Garden all together some of you some of the progeny being enemies of others because of some wronging others. Yet if the nūn of the conditional particle in has been assimilated with the mā which is extra there should come to you guidance from Me then whoever follows My guidance the Qur’ān shall not go astray in this world neither shall he be miserable in the Hereafter.
Tâ Hâ,20,124,"But he who turneth away from remembrance of Me, his will be a narrow life, and I shall bring him blind to the assembly on the Day of Resurrection.",But whoever disregards My remembrance disregards the Qur’ān and does not believe in it his shall be a straitened life read dankan with nunation a verbal noun meaning ‘straitened circumstances’. This statement has been interpreted in one hadīth to mean the punishment of the grave for the disbeliever. And on the Day of Resurrection We shall bring him to the assembly namely the one who disregards the Qur’ān blind’ blind in eyesight.
Tâ Hâ,20,125,"He will say: My Lord! Wherefor hast Thou gathered me (hither) blind, when I was wont to see ?",He shall say ‘My Lord why have you brought be to the assembly blind though I used to see?’ in the world and at the raising from the grave?
Tâ Hâ,20,126,He will say: So (it must be). Our revelations came unto thee but thou didst forget them. In like manner thou art forgotten this Day.,He will say ‘So it the affair is. Our signs came to you but you forgot them you neglected them and did not believe in them; and so just as you forgot Our signs today you will be forgotten’ abandoned in the Fire.
Tâ Hâ,20,127,Thus do We reward him who is prodigal and believeth not the revelations of his Lord; and verily the doom of the Hereafter will be sterner and more lasting.,And so just as We requite him who disregards the Qur’ān We requite him who is prodigal him who associates others with God and believes not in the signs of his Lord. And the chastisement of the Hereafter is more terrible than the chastisement of the life of this world and the punishment of the grave and more enduring longer lasting.
Tâ Hâ,20,128,"Is it not a guidance for them (to know) how many a generation We destroyed before them, amid whose dwellings they walk ? Lo! therein verily are signs for men of thought.",Is it not a guidance has it not become clear to them to the disbelievers of Mecca how many kam is predicative and the object of the following ahlaknā We destroyed in other words Our frequent destruction before them of generations that is of past communities for denying messengers amid the ruins of whose dwelling-places they walk? yamshūna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person of the pronoun lahum ‘to them’ during their journeys to Syria and other places that they might thus be admonished? what has been mentioned by grammarians regarding the derivation of the verb ihlāk to be that verb that does not contain a particle referring to the object of the action of the verb as a way of preserving the original sense of the statement is acceptable. Surely in that there are signs lessons for people of sense for possessors of intellect.
Tâ Hâ,20,129,"And but for a decree that had already gone forth from thy Lord, and a term already fixed, the judgment would have been inevitable (in this world).",And but for a decree that had already preceded from your Lord that their chastisement be deferred to the Hereafter it destruction would have been an inevitability their destruction would have been necessary in this world and a specified term fixed for them ajalun musamman a supplement to the pronoun concealed in kāna ‘it would have been’ the separation of both subjects by the predicate of both serves as an emphasis.
Tâ Hâ,20,130,"Therefor (O Muhammad), bear with what they say, and celebrate the praise of thy Lord ere the rising of the sun and ere the going down thereof. And glorify Him some hours of the night and at the two ends of the day, that thou mayst find acceptance.",So be patient with what they say — this is abrogated by the ‘fighting’ verse cf. Q. 2190ff — and make glorifications pray by praising your Lord bi-hamdi rabbika is a circumstantial qualifier in other words ‘ensconced in such praise’ before the rising of the sun the morning prayer and before its setting — the afternoon prayer — and in the watches of the night during the hours thereof and make glorifications perform the sunset and the evening prayer and at either side of the day wa-atrāfa’l-nahāri a supplement to the syntactical locus of the accusative clause wa-min ānā’i ‘and in the watches’ in other words perform the noon prayer because the time for it begins at the point where the sun starts to go down which is the end side of the first half of the day and the start side of the second half of the day; that perhaps you may be pleased with the reward that you will be given.

The provision of thy Lord is better and more lasting.",And do not extend your glance toward what We have given to some pairs certain categories among them to enjoy as the flower of the life of this world its adornment and delight that We may try them thereby to see if they transgress the bounds. And your Lord’s provision in Paradise is better than what they have been given in this world and more enduring longer lasting.

Hath there not come unto them the proof of what is in the former scriptures ?,And they the idolaters say ‘Why does he Muhammad (s) not bring us a sign from his Lord?’ of the sort which they request. Has there not come to them read ta’tihim or ya’tihim the clear proof the statements of what is in the former scriptures? the tales contained in the Qur’ān relating to past communities and the details of their destruction for denying the messengers?

If only Thou hadst sent unto us a messenger, so that we might have followed Thy revelations before we were (thus) humbled and disgraced!",Had We destroyed them with a chastisement before him before the coming of Muhammad (s) the Messenger they would have said on the Day of Resurrection ‘Our Lord if only You had sent us a messenger so that we might have followed those signs of Yours given to the messengers to convey before we were thus abased at the Resurrection and disgraced?’ in Hell.
Tâ Hâ,20,135,"Say: Each is awaiting; so await ye! Ye will come to know who are the owners of the path of equity, and who is right.",Say to them ‘Each one of us and you is waiting to see what this affair will lead to. So wait!

The Prophets,21,2,"Never cometh there unto them a new reminder from their Lord but they listen to it while they play,",There does not come to them any new reminder from their Lord revealed gradually in other words new words of the Qur’ān but they listen to it as they play as they engage in mockery
The Prophets,21,3,With hearts preoccupied. And they confer in secret. The wrong- doers say: Is this other than a mortal like you ? Will ye then succumb to magic when ye see (it) ?,with their hearts preoccupied heedless of its meanings.

Will you then take to sorcery will you succumb and follow it even though you are able to see?’ even though you know that it is sorcery?

The Prophets,21,5,"Nay, say they, (these are but) muddled dreams; nay, he hath but invented it; nay, he is but a poet. Let him bring us a portent even as those of old (who were God’s messengers) were sent (with portents).",Nay bal in the three instances below effects a transition from one subject to another but they say regarding those parts of the Qur’ān he the Prophet has brought to them are ‘A muddle of nightmares a confusion of things he has seen in his sleep. Nay he has fabricated it he has invented it; nay he is a poet and what he has brought is merely poetry! So let him bring us a sign such as was sent to the ancients’ like the she-camel Sālih the staff and the glowing hand of Moses. God exalted be He says
The Prophets,21,6,Not a township believed of those which We destroyed before them (though We sent them portents): would they then believe ?,No town before them ever believed — meaning none of its inhabitants — of those that We destroyed for the denial of the signs brought to them. Would they then believe? No.
The Prophets,21,7,"And We sent not (as Our messengers) before thee other than men, whom We inspired. Ask the followers of the Reminder if ye know not ?",And We sent none before you other than men to whom We revealed read nūhī or yūhā ‘to whom it is revealed’ and We sent not any angels.

Since you are more likely to believe them than the believers are to believing Muhammad (s).
The Prophets,21,8,"We gave them not bodies that would not eat food, nor were they immortals.",And We did not make them namely the messengers bodies that did not eat food nay they eat it; and they were not immortal in this world.

Will you not understand? and so believe in it?
The Prophets,21,11,"How many a community that dealt unjustly have We shattered, and raised up after them another folk!",And how many did We destroy of towns — meaning its inhabitants — that had been wrongdoing disbelieving and brought forth another people after it!
The Prophets,21,12,"And, when they felt Our might, behold them fleeing from it!",And when they felt Our might when the inhabitants of the town sensed destruction to be near behold they ran away from it they flee hastily therefrom.
The Prophets,21,13,"(But it was said unto them): Flee not, but return to that (existence) which emasculated you and to your dwellings, that ye may be questioned.",But the angels said to them scornfully ‘Do not run away! Return to the opulence the comforts which you were given to enjoy and your dwelling-places that perhaps you might be asked’ for something of your worldly possessions as usual.
The Prophets,21,14,They cried: Alas for us! we were wrong-doers.,They said ‘O yā is for calling attention to something woe to us! this is our destruction! We have indeed been doing wrong’ through our disbelief.
The Prophets,21,15,"And this their crying ceased not till We made them as reaped corn, extinct.",So that saying remained their cry which they would make and repeat until We made them as reaped crops as crops harvested with sickles when they were killed with the sword stilled dead like the stillness of fire when it is extinguished.

The Prophets,21,17,"If We had wished to find a pastime, We could have found it in Our presence - if We ever did.",Had We desired to find some diversion that which provides diversion in the way of a partner or a child We would have found it with Ourselves from among the beautiful-eyed houris or angels were We to do so. But We did not do so thus We never desired it.

And yours will be woe for that which ye ascribe (unto Him).",Nay but We hurl We cast the truth faith against falsehood disbelief and it obliterates it and behold it vanishes disappears damaghahu ‘it obliterates it’ actually means ‘it struck the brain with a blow’ a blow which is fatal. And for you O disbelievers of Mecca there shall be woe severe chastisement for what you ascribe to God of mate or child.

The Prophets,21,21,Or have they chosen gods from the earth who raise the dead ?,Or am functions with the meaning of bal ‘nay’ to effect a transition in subject-matter; the hamza is for rhetorical denial have they chosen gods that are from the earth such as stones gold or silver who that is gods who resurrect? who bring the dead back to life? No! Indeed only one who brings the dead back to life can be God.
The Prophets,21,22,"If there were therein gods beside Allah, then verily both (the heavens and the earth) had been disordered. Glorified be Allah, the Lord of the Throne, from all that they ascribe (unto Him).",Had there been in either of them that is in the heavens and the earth gods other than God that is other than Him the two would have surely deteriorated they the heavens and the earth would have deviated from their observed order because counteractive forces would exist among such gods as is usually the case when there is more than one ruler that there is counteraction and a lack of consensus regarding something. So glory be to God — an exaltation — the Lord the Creator of the Throne al-kursī above what they ascribe the disbelievers to God of His having a partner and otherwise.

This is the Reminder of those with me and those before me, but most of them know not the Truth and so they are averse.",Or have they chosen besides Him exalted be He other than Him gods? herein is an interrogative meant as a rebuke. Say ‘Bring your proof for this — but such a thing is impossible. This is the Remembrance of those with me namely my community and that Remembrance is the Qur’ān and the Remembrance of those before me of communities namely the Torah and the Gospel and other Books of God not a single one of which contains the statement that with God there exists another god in the way that they claim — exalted be He above such a thing. Nay but most of them do not know the truth the affirmation of God’s Oneness and so they are disregardful’ of that discernment that leads to knowledge of it.
The Prophets,21,25,"And We sent no messenger before thee but We inspired him, (saying): There is no God save Me (Allah), so worship Me.",And We did not send any Messenger before you but We revealed to him read nūhī or yūhā ‘but it was revealed to him’ that ‘There is no god except Me so worship Me’ that is affirm My Oneness.

Nay, but (those whom they call sons) are honoured slaves;",And they say ‘The Compassionate One has taken a son’ from the angels. Glory be to Him!

Thus We Repay wrong-doers.",And should any of them say ‘I am a god besides Him’ that is besides God in other words a god other than Him — and this is Iblīs who summoned others to worship his soul and commanded that it be obeyed — such a one We will requite with Hell. Thus in the same way that We requite him We requite wrong-doers idolaters.
The Prophets,21,30,"Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were of one piece, then We parted them, and we made every living thing of water ? Will they not then believe ?",Have they not one may read a-wa-lam or a-lam realised have they not come to know those who disbelieve that the heavens and the earth were closed together and then We parted them We made seven heavens and seven earths — or it is meant that the heaven was parted and began to rain when it did not use to do so and that the earth was parted and began to produce plants when it did not use to do so; and We made of water the water that falls from the heaven and that springs from the earth every living thing? in the way of plants and otherwise in other words water is the cause of such things having life.

The Prophets,21,31,"And We have placed in the earth firm hills lest it quake with them, and We have placed therein ravines as roads that haply they may find their way.",And We set in the earth firm mountains lest it should shake with them and We set in them in the firm mountains ravines as roads subulan substitutes for fijājan ‘ravines’ which are wide through-routes that perhaps they may be guided to their destinations during travel.

Yet they turn away from its portents.,And We made the heaven a roof for the earth functioning like the roof of a house preserved from collapsing; and yet of the signs thereof namely the signs of this heaven such as the sun the moon and the stars they are disregardful failing to reflect on them and thus realise that the Creator of such things can have no partner.
The Prophets,21,33,"And He it is Who created the night and the day, and the sun and the moon. They float, each in an orbit.",And He it is Who created the night and the day and the sun and the moon each kullun the nunation of this particle stands in place of the second noun of the genitive construction that would have been al-shams ‘the sun’ or al-qamar ‘the moon’ or their subsidiaries namely al-nujūm ‘the stars’ in an orbit a circular one like a mill in the sky swimming moving with speed like a swimmer in water. In order to effect the analogy with the latter the plural person of the verb employed for rational beings is used.
The Prophets,21,34,"We appointed immortality for no mortal before thee. What! if thou diest, can they be immortal!",When the disbelievers said that Muhammad (s) would die the following was revealed And We did not assign to any human being before you immortality permanence of life in this world. What if you are fated to die will they be immortal? in it? No! The last sentence constitutes the syntactical locus of the interrogative of denial.
The Prophets,21,35,"Every soul must taste of death, and We try you with evil and with good, for ordeal. And unto Us ye will be returned.",Every soul shall taste death in this world and We will try you We will test you with ill and good such as poverty and wealth sickness and health as an ordeal fitnatan an object denoting reason in other words for the purpose of seeing whether you will be patient and give thanks or not.

I shall show you My portents, but ask Me not to hasten.",The following was revealed regarding their demand that chastisement be hastened Man was created of haste that is to say because he is so hasty in his affairs it is as if he had been created out of it.

The Prophets,21,40,"Nay, but it will come upon them unawares so that it will stupefy them, and they will be unable to repel it, neither will they be reprieved.",Nay but it the Resurrection shall come upon them suddenly dumbfounding them confusing them and they shall not be able to ward it off nor shall they be granted any respite nor shall they be given any extra time to make a repentance or offer an excuse.

And to each of the twain We gave judgement prophethood and knowledge in matters of religion. And We disposed the mountains to glorify God with David and the birds also were disposed to glorify God with him for he David had commanded such glorification on their part so that whenever there was a lapse on his part he would be reminded to apply himself to the task of glorifying God promptly.

The Prophets,21,86,And We brought them in unto Our mercy. Lo! they are among the righteous.,And We admitted them into Our mercy through granting them prophethood. Indeed they were among the worthy of it. Dhū’l-Kifl was so called because he undertook takaffala to fast every day and stay up every night in prayer and to pass judgement between people without succumbing to anger and fulfilled this undertaking. It is also said however that he was not a prophet.
The Prophets,21,87,"And (mention) Dhu’n-Nun, when he went off in anger and deemed that We had no power over him, but he cried out in the darkness, saying: There is no God save Thee. Be Thou Glorified! Lo! I have been a wrong-doer.",And mention Dhū’l-Nūn the one of the whale namely Jonah son of Amittai Yūnus bin Mattā when he went off enraged Dhā’l-Nūn is substituted by the clause idh dhahaba mughādiban by his people that is furious with them because of what he had suffered at their hands — even though he had not been granted permission by God to go off as he did — thinking that We had no power over him that is that We could not compel him to submit to Our decree in the way that We did by imprisoning him inside the stomach of the whale; or that We could not make circumstances difficult for him. Then he cried out in the darknesses through the darkness of the night the darkness of the sea and the darkness of the whale’s stomach that ‘There is no god except You! Glory be to You! I have indeed been one of the wrongdoers’ for leaving my people without Your permission.
The Prophets,21,88,Then we heard his prayer and saved him from the anguish.

Truly they those prophets that have been mentioned would hasten to they would hurry to perform good works namely acts of obedience and supplicate Us out of desire for Our mercy and in awe of Our chastisement and they were submissive before Us humble in their worship.
The Prophets,21,91,"And she who was chaste, therefor We breathed into her (something) of Our Spirit and made her and her son a token for (all) peoples.",And mention Mary the one who guarded her virginity the one who preserved it from being taken so We breathed into her of Our spirit namely Gabriel when he breathed into the opening of her garment and she conceived Jesus.

The Prophets,21,97,"And the True Promise draweth nigh; then behold them, staring wide (in terror), the eyes of those who disbelieve! (They say): Alas for us! We (lived) in forgetfulness of this. Ah, but we were wrong-doers!",And the true promise that is the Day of Resurrection draws near and behold when the gaze of the disbelievers will be fixed on that Day because of its severity saying ‘O yā is for exclamation woe to us! this is our destruction!

Thereunto ye will come.,‘Truly you O people of Mecca and what you worship besides God that is other than Him in the way of graven images shall be fuel for Hell you shall be its fodder; and you shall come to it’ you shall enter it.
The Prophets,21,99,"If these had been gods they would not have come thither, but all will abide therein.",Had these graven images been gods as you claim they would never have come to it they would never have entered it and they will all both the worshippers and the worshipped abide therein.
The Prophets,21,100,"Therein wailing is their portion, and therein they hear not.",For them for the worshippers there will be groaning therein and they will not hear in it anything because of the ferocity with which it boils.

We are to perform it.",The day yawma is in the accusative because of an implied preceding udhkur ‘mention’ when We shall roll up the heaven as the Scribe al-sijill being the name of an angel rolls up the written scroll that is the scroll of the son of Adam when he dies the lām of li’l-kitāb is extra; alternatively one may read the verse so that al-sijill is ‘the scroll’ and al-kitāb means al-maktūb ‘what is written’ in which case the lām of li’l-kitāb has the sense of the particle ‘alā ‘over’; a variant reading for li’l-kitāb has the plural li’l-kutub ‘the books’. As We began the first creation from non-existence We shall repeat it after making it non-existent the kāf of ka-mā ‘as’ is semantically connected to nu‘īdu ‘We shall repeat it’ and its suffixed pronoun -hu ‘it’ refers back to awwala ‘the first’; the mā relates to the verbal noun — a promise binding on Us wa‘dan is in the accusative because it is the direct object of an implied preceding wa‘adnā ‘We promised’ and the clause constitutes a confirmation of the import of the preceding verse 103.

Will ye then surrender (unto Him) ?,Say ‘All that is being revealed to me is that your God is One God that is the only thing that is being revealed to me with respect to the Divine is His Oneness. So will you submit?’ will you accede to affirming the Oneness of the Divine that is being revealed to me? the interrogative is meant as an imperative.
The Prophets,21,109,"But if they are averse, then say: I have warned you all alike, although I know not whether nigh or far is that which ye are promised.",But if they turn away from this say ‘I have proclaimed to you I have notified you of my declaration of war on you all alike ‘alā sawā’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to both the subject of the verb and the object that is to say you are all equal in having knowledge of this I shall not proceed independently without having first informed you in order for you to make preparations although I do not know whether near or far is that which you have been promised’ with respect to chastisement or to the Day of Resurrection that comprises this chastisement; only God knows it.

The Prophets,21,112,"He saith: My Lord! Judge Thou with truth. Our Lord is the Beneficent, Whose help is to be implored against that which ye ascribe (unto Him).",Say qul a variant reading has qāla ‘He said’ ‘My Lord! Judge between me and my deniers with truth by assigning chastisement for them or victory for me over them. And so they were chastised at the battles of Badr Uhud Hunayn al-Ahzāb and al-Khandaq and he the Prophet was given victory over them. And our Lord is the Compassionate One Whose help is to be sought against what you allege’ when you invent lies against God saying that ‘God has taken a son’ cf. Q. 2116; and against me when you say ‘he is a sorcerer’ cf. Q. 384 or against the Qur’ān when you say ‘it is poetry’ cf. Q. 5230.

And there are some of you who are taken away by death before coming of age and there are some of you who are relegated to the most abject time of life its most despicable state of decrepitude and senility so that after having had some knowledge he no longer knows anything — ‘Ikrima said ‘Whoever recites the Qur’ān such a state will not befall him’.

The Pilgrimage,22,29,Then let them make an end of their unkemptness and pay their vows and go around the ancient House.,Then let them do away with their self-neglect that is to say let them remove any dirt or unkemptness such as any long fingernails and let them fulfil read wa’l-yūfū or wa’l-yuwaffū their vows in the way of offerings and sacrifices and perform the circumambulation the circumambulation following the egress from ‘Arafa of the Ancient House’ that is the Old one because it was the first House founded for mankind.
The Pilgrimage,22,30,"That (is the command). And whoso magnifieth the sacred things of Allah, it will be well for him in the sight of his Lord. The cattle are lawful unto you save that which hath been told you. So shun the filth of idols, and shun lying speech,",That is that dhālika the predicate of an implied subject in other words ‘the matter’ or ‘the affair’ is ‘that which has been mentioned’. And whoever venerates the sacraments of God namely those things whose violation is forbidden that veneration of them shall be better for him with his Lord in the Hereafter. And cattle are lawful for you to consume after their slaughter except for that which has been recited to you as being unlawful in the verse Forbidden to you is carrion … Q. 53. The exceptive clause above is a discontinuous one; but it could also be taken as continuous so that the prohibition is of that which has died and so on. So avoid the abomination of idols mina’l-awthān min here is explicative as opposed to partitive in other words ‘avoid abomination namely idols’ and avoid false speech that is to say ascribing partners to God in your uttering of the talbiya or avoid bearing false witness;
The Pilgrimage,22,31,"Turning unto Allah (only), not ascribing partners unto Him; for whoso ascribeth partners unto Allah, it is as if he had fallen from the sky and the birds had snatched him or the wind had blown him to a far-off place.",being hanīfs to God being of those who have submitted to God inclining away from every religion except His religion not ascribing partners to Him this clause emphasises the preceding one both clauses being circumstantial qualifiers referring to the third person plural indicator wāw of ijtanibū ‘avoid’.

The Pilgrimage,22,32,"That (is the command). And whoso magnifieth the offerings consecrated to Allah, it surely is from devotion of the hearts,",That dhālika an implied subject al-amru ‘the matter is’ is taken to precede this predicate. And whoever venerates the sacraments of God then that in other words then that veneration of them — namely of the beasts of sacrifice offered in the Sanctuary after the best of them have been selected and fattened — derives from the piety of the hearts of those individuals. These sacraments are called sha‘ā’ir because they are marked out ish‘ār with something to indicate that they are offerings such as having a hump pierced with a piece of metal.
The Pilgrimage,22,33,Therein are benefits for you for an appointed term; and afterward they are brought for sacrifice unto the ancient House.,You may benefit from them such as riding on them and carrying your loads on them in a way that does not harm them until a specified time the time for its immolation.

There is good for you in them benefit for you in this world as already mentioned and a reward in the Hereafter. So mention God’s Name over them at the point of immolating them when they are lined up standing on three legs with the left foreleg hobbled.

So that is similar to such a disposal We have disposed them for you that it may be immolated or ridden — for otherwise it would not have been possible — that perhaps you might be thankful for My graces to you.
The Pilgrimage,22,37,"Their flesh and their food reach not Allah, but the devotion from you reacheth Him. Thus have We made them subject unto you that ye may magnify Allah that He hath guided you. And give good tidings (O Muhammad) to the good.",Neither their flesh nor their blood shall reach God that is neither of these shall be raised up to Him; rather it is your piety that shall reach Him that is it is your righteous action performed purely for Him together with your faith that shall be raised up to Him.

The Pilgrimage,22,40,"Those who have been driven from their homes unjustly only because they said: Our Lord is Allah - For had it not been for Allah’s repelling some men by means of others, cloisters and churches and oratories and mosques, wherein the name of Allah is oft mentioned, would assuredly have been pulled down. Verily Allah helpeth one who helpeth Him. Lo! Allah is Strong, Almighty -",they are those who were expelled from their homes without right for their expulsion; they were expelled only because they said that is because of their saying ‘Our Lord is God’ alone such a saying is ‘right’ and so then to be expelled for saying it is to be expelled without right. Were it not for God’s causing some people ba‘dahum ‘some’ substitutes for al-nāsa ‘people’ to drive back others destruction would have befallen read la-huddimat to emphasise a great number of destructions; or read la-hudimat the monasteries sawāmi‘ is for monks and churches kanā’is are for Christians and synagogues salawāt is the Hebrew term for Jewish houses of worship kanā’is and mosques masājid are for Muslims in which that is in which mentioned places God’s Name is mentioned greatly and with such destruction acts of worship cease.

And Allah’s is the sequel of events.",those who if We empower them in the land by granting them victory over their enemies maintain the prayer and pay the alms and enjoin decency and forbid indecency this last is the response to the conditional clause which together with the response constitute a relative clause of the relative noun ‘those who’; hum ‘they are’ may be taken as the implied subject before this. And with God rests the outcome of all matters in other words to Him these matters return in the Hereafter.
The Pilgrimage,22,42,"If they deny thee (Muhammad), even so the folk of Noah, and (the tribes of) A’ad and Thamud, before thee, denied (Our messengers);",And if they deny you — these words to the end of the statement are meant to comfort the Prophet s — the people of Noah denied before them kadhdhabat in the feminine person on the basis of the overall import and ‘Ād the people of Hūd and Thamūd the people of Sālih
The Pilgrimage,22,43,And the folk of Abraham and the folk of Lot;,as well as the people of Abraham and the people of Lot
The Pilgrimage,22,44,"(And) the dwellers in Midian. And Moses was denied; but I indulged the disbelievers a long while, then I seized them, and how (terrible) was My abhorrence!",and the inhabitants of Midian the people of Shu‘ayb and Moses was also denied he was denied by the native Egyptians al-qibt and not by his people the Children of Israel. In other words all of those people denied their messengers so take them these messengers as a good example of constancy. And I granted the disbelievers respite I postponed dealing with them by deferring their requital then I seized them with chastisement and how terrible was My abhorrence! nakīr that is to say My rebuke inkār of them for their denial by My destroying them the interrogative is meant as an affirmative in other words it My chastisement was well-placed.

The Pilgrimage,22,46,"Have they not travelled in the land, and have they hearts wherewith to feel and ears wherewith to hear ? For indeed it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it is the hearts, which are within the bosoms, that grow blind.",Have they namely the disbelievers of Mecca not travelled in the land so that they may have hearts with which to comprehend what befell deniers before them or ears with which to hear? the stories of how they were destroyed and their dwelling-places were ruined and so take heed?

The Pilgrimage,22,52,"Never sent We a messenger or a prophet before thee but when He recited (the message) Satan proposed (opposition) in respect of that which he recited thereof. But Allah abolisheth that which Satan proposeth. Then Allah establisheth His revelations. Allah is Knower, Wise;",And We did not send before you any messenger rasūl — this is a prophet who has been commanded to deliver a Message — or prophet nabī — one who has not been commanded to deliver anything — but that when he recited the scripture Satan cast into his recitation what is not from the Qur’ān but which those to whom he the prophet had been sent would find pleasing. The Prophet s had during an assembly of the men of Quraysh after reciting the following verses from sūrat al-Najm Have you considered Lāt and ‘Uzzā? And Manāt the third one? 5319-20 added as a result of Satan casting them onto his tongue without his the Prophet’s being aware of it the following words ‘those are the high-flying cranes al-gharānīq al-‘ulā and indeed their intercession is to be hoped for’ and so they the men of Quraysh were thereby delighted.

Send me back’ is merely a word that he speaks but a word in which there is no benefit for him; and behind them ahead of them there is a barrier which prevents them from going back to this world until the day when they are raised after which day there will be no more return.

Among those ridiculed were Bilāl al-Habashī Suhayb al-Rūmī ‘Ammār b. Yāsir and Salmān al-Fārisī; until they made you forget My remembrance which you disregarded as you were engaged in deriding them. Thus these men were the cause of the forgetting which is why this act has been attributed to them and you used to laugh at them.

Light,24,2,"The adulterer and the adulteress, scourge ye each one of them (with) a hundred stripes. And let not pity for the twain withhold you from obedience to Allah, if ye believe in Allah and the Last Day. And let a party of believers witness their punishment.",As for the fornicatress and the fornicator that is of those not in wedlock — because those in wedlock are stoned according to the Sunna the al in al-zāniya ‘the fornicatress’ and al-zānī ‘the fornicator’ according to some mentioned opinions is a relative particle; the clause al-zāniyatu wa’l-zānī is a subject and because of its similarity to a conditional the fā’ has been inserted into the predicate which is the following fa’jlidū strike each of them a hundred lashes a hundred strikes one says jaladahu to mean daraba jildahu ‘he struck him on the skin’. According to the Sunna in addition to this punishment there is also banishment for a whole year. The slave however receives half of the mentioned punishment. And do not let any pity for them overcome you in God’s religion that is to say in the fulfilment of His rulings by disregarding any part of their prescribed punishment if you believe in God and the Last Day namely the Day of Resurrection in this statement there is an incitement to abide by what was mentioned before the conditional above and it also constitutes the response to the latter or at least is an indication of the response to it. And let their punishment the flogging be witnessed by a group of the believers — some say that this should be a group of three; some say four as in the number of witnesses testifying to an act of fornication.

This was revealed when the poor among the Emigrants resolved to marry the wealthy whores of the idolaters so that they the women would provide for them.

Light,24,7,"And yet a fifth, invoking the curse of Allah on him if he is of those who lie.",and a fifth time that God’s wrath shall be upon him if he were lying in this the predicate of the subject fa-shahādatu ahadihim ‘then the testimony of one of them’ is the implicit ‘will spare him the prescribed legal punishment for false accusation’.
Light,24,8,"And it shall avert the punishment from her if she bear witness before Allah four times that the thing he saith is indeed false,",And the punishment namely the prescribed legal punishment for fornication that is established upon his testimony shall be averted from her if she testify swearing by God four times that he is indeed lying in accusing her of having fornicated;

Light,24,11,"Lo! they who spread the slander are a gang among you. Deem it not a bad thing for you; nay, it is good for you. Unto every man of them (will be paid) that which he hath earned of the sin; and as for him among them who had the greater share therein, his will be an awful doom.",Truly those who initiated the slander the worst calumny against ‘Ā’isha — mother of the believers may God be pleased with her — accusing her of fornication are a band from among yourselves a group from among the believers. She said that these were Hassān b. Thābit ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy Mistah b. Uthātha and Hamna bt. Jahsh. Do not suppose O you believers other than the mentioned band that it is bad for you; rather it is good for you for God will reward you for it and reveal ‘Ā’isha’s innocence and the innocence of the one who is supposed to have committed it with her namely Safwān b. al-Mu‘attal. She ‘Ā’isha related ‘I accompanied the Prophet s during a raid and this was after the requirement to wear the veil had been revealed. When he was through with it the raid he headed back to the campsite and one night having drawn close to Medina he announced that all should march off home. So I walked a distance away from the campsite and relieved myself. But when I came back to the campsite I realised that my necklace ‘iqd meaning qilāda had snapped. So I went back to look for it. In the meantime they had strapped my litter’ — in which one rides — ‘thinking that I was inside for in those days women were slight and ate very small portions ‘ulqa. Finally I found my necklace but when I went back to where I had been staying overnight they had already departed. I sat in the place where I had camped; I assumed that the group would notice my absence and come back for me. But my eyes were overcome by drowsiness and I fell asleep. Safwān had pitched camp behind the army to rest for some of the night ‘arrasa then set off while it was still night until he reached the site of the camp. He saw what looked like a person sleeping and recognised me when he eventually saw me having seen me on numerous occasions before the requirement of the veil. I woke up to the sound of him saying ‘To God we belong and to Him we shall surely return’ innā li’Llāhi wa-innā ilayhi rāji‘ūn for he had recognised me. So I concealed my face with my gown jilbāb — in other words I covered it up with my wrap mulā’a.
Light,24,12,"Why did not the believers, men and women, when ye heard it, think good of their own own folk, and say: It is a manifest untruth ?",Why when you first heard about it did the believing men and women not think good of themselves that is why did some not think good of others and say ‘This is a manifest calumny?’ this is a patent lie? there is a shift here in the address from the second to the third person in other words why did you not assume good of them O band of believers and say
Light,24,13,"Why did they not produce four witnesses ? Since they produce not witnesses, they verily are liars in the sight of Allah.",Why did they that is this band of accusers not produce four witnesses to it? who had witnessed it. And since they did not produce the witnesses those in God’s sight in His judgement they are liars in this matter.
Light,24,14,Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you in the world and the Hereafter an awful doom had overtaken you for that whereof ye murmured.,And were it not for God’s bounty to you and His mercy in the life of this world and the Hereafter there would have befallen you for what you O band of accusers engaged in for what you indulged in an awful chastisement in the Hereafter;

In the sight of Allah it is very great.",when you were receiving it welcomingly with your tongues that is to say when you were reporting it one from the other one of the two letters tā’ has been omitted from the verb tatalaqqawnahu ‘you were receiving it’; idh ‘when’ is dependent because of massakum ‘befallen you’ or afadtum ‘engaged in’ and were uttering with your mouths that whereof you had no knowledge supposing it to be a light matter a sinless act while with God it was grave in sinfulness.
Light,24,16,"Wherefor, when ye heard it, said ye not: It is not for us to speak of this. Glory be to Thee (O Allah)! This is awful calumny.",And why when you heard it did you not say ‘It is not for us to speak about this. Glory be to You! — this exclamation here is meant to indicate amazement — This is an awful calumny?’ an awful lie?
Light,24,17,"Allah admonisheth you that ye repeat not the like thereof ever, if ye are (in truth) believers.",God admonishes you He forbids you lest you should ever repeat the like of it if you are in truth believers then you will be admonished by this.
Light,24,18,"And He expoundeth unto you the revelations. Allah is Knower, Wise.",And God clarifies for you the signs through commands and prohibitions and God is Knower of what He enjoins and what He prohibits Wise therein.
Light,24,19,"Lo! those who love that slander should be spread concerning those who believe, theirs will be a painful punishment in the world and the Hereafter. Allah knoweth. Ye know not.",Truly those who love that indecency should be spread by the tongue concerning those who believe by its being associated with them — and the ones meant are the band — theirs will be a painful chastisement in the life of this world by way of the prescribed legal punishment for false accusation and the Hereafter by way of the Fire as is God’s due and God knows that such indecency does not apply in their case and you O band of accusers as regards the calumny of which you spoke do not know whether such indecency took place among them.
Light,24,20,"Had it not been for the grace of Allah and His mercy unto you, and that Allah is Clement, Merciful, (ye had been undone).",And were it not for God’s bounty to you O band of accusers and His mercy and that God is Gentle Merciful to you He would have surely hastened to bring about your punishment.

And Allah is Hearer, Knower.",O you who believe do not follow in the steps of Satan that is his ways of making things seem attractive. For whoever follows in the steps of Satan assuredly he the one being followed enjoins indecency that is he enjoins vile acts and what is reprehensible if followed according to the Law. And were it not for God’s bounty to you and His mercy not one of you O band of accusers would ever have grown pure after the calumny of which you spoke that is to say not one of you would have ever been reformed or purified from this sin by repenting of it. But God purifies whom He will from sin by accepting his repentance from him and God is Hearer of what you have said Knower of your intentions.
Light,24,22,"And let not those who possess dignity and ease among you swear not to give to the near of kin and to the needy, and to fugitives for the cause of Allah. Let them forgive and show indulgence. Yearn ye not that Allah may forgive you ? Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.",And do not let those of you who possess bounty the wealthy and the affluent swear not to give to the near of kin and the poor and those who emigrate in the way of God — this was revealed regarding Abū Bakr who swore to provide no more for Mistah his maternal cousin a destitute Emigrant who had fought at the battle of Badr because of his involvement in the calumny when thitherto he had provided for him. And it was revealed also regarding certain Companions who swore not to give voluntary alms to those who had participated in spreading the calumny in any way. Let them forgive and excuse them in this matter. Do you not love that God should forgive you? And God is Forgiving Merciful to believers. Abū Bakr said ‘Indeed. I would love that God forgive me’ and he restored thereafter to Mistah what he used to expend on him.
Light,24,23,"Lo! as for those who traduce virtuous, believing women (who are) careless, cursed are they in the world and the Hereafter. Theirs will be an awful doom",Truly those who make accusations of fornication against honourably married chaste women who are unaware of indecent acts — since it would never occur to them to commit such acts — who believe in God and His Messenger shall be cursed in this world and the Hereafter; and there will be an awful chastisement for them
Light,24,24,"On the day when their tongues and their hands and their feet testify against them as to what they used to do,",on the day yawma is in the accusative because of the implicit sense of ‘permanence’ to which lahum ‘for them’ is semantically connected when their tongues and their hands and their feet shall testify against them read feminine person tashhadu or masculine person yashhadu ‘testify’ concerning what they used to do in terms of speech and action — this day is the Day of Resurrection.
Light,24,25,"On that day Allah will pay them their just due, and they will know that Allah, He is the Manifest Truth.",On that day God will pay them in full their just due He will requite them with the requital they deserve and they shall know that God is the Manifest Truth since He will have realised for them that requital of His whereof they had been in doubt. Among such people is ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy. The ‘honourable women’ mentioned above are the Prophet’s s wives regarding whom no repentance has been mentioned as being possible in the case of their being falsely accused; those women regarding whom repentance has been mentioned however at the beginning of the sūra verses 4-5 in the case of their being falsely accused are women other these wives of the Prophet.
Light,24,26,"Vile women are for vile men, and vile men for vile women. Good women are for good men, and good men for good women; such are innocent of that which people say: For them is pardon and a bountiful provision.",Vile women and vile words are for vile men and vile men for vile women and the mentioned vile words. Good women and as mentioned good words are for good men and good men for good women and the mentioned good words that is to say what suits something vile is its like and what suits something good is its like — such good men and women the like of ‘Ā’isha and Safwān are absolved of what they say what the corrupt men and women say about them. For them for good men and women will be forgiveness and a glorious provision in Paradise. ‘Ā’isha felt honoured by some of the things mentioned in this verse namely that she was created ‘a good woman’ and was promised ‘forgiveness and a glorious provision’.
Light,24,27,"O ye who believe! Enter not houses other than your own without first announcing your presence and invoking peace upon the folk thereof. That is better for you, that ye may be heedful.",O you who believe do not enter houses other than your houses until you have first asked permission and greeted their occupants. So a person must say ‘Peace be upon you may I enter?’ as is stated in one hadīth. That is better for you than entering without permission that perhaps you might remember tadhakkarūna the second tā’ of tatadhakkarūna has been assimilated with the dhāl the superiority of such conduct and so follow it.
Light,24,28,"And if ye find no-one therein, still enter not until permission hath been given. And if it be said unto you: Go away again, then go away, for it is purer for you. Allah knoweth what ye do.",And if you do not find anyone in them to give you permission still do not enter them until permission has been given to you. And if it is said to you when you are seeking permission ‘Go away’ then go away for this going away is purer that is better for you than sitting and waiting at the doorstep. And God knows what you do whether you enter with permission or without it and He will requite you for it.
Light,24,29,(It is) no sin for you to enter uninhabited houses wherein is comfort for you. Allah knoweth what ye proclaim and what ye hide.,You would not be at fault if you enter without permission uninhabited houses wherein is comfort some benefit for you in the way of finding shelter and so on as in the case of travellers inns and charitable hostels. And God knows what you disclose what you do openly and what you hide what you do secretly when entering houses other than your own be it for a righteous purpose or otherwise. It will be mentioned shortly that they should bid themselves peace when entering their own houses.
Light,24,30,Tell the believing men to lower their gaze and be modest. That is purer for them. Lo! Allah is aware of what they do.,Tell believing men to lower their gaze from what is unlawful for them to look at min of min absārihim ‘their gaze’ is extra and to guard their private parts from doing with them what is unlawful for them to do. That is purer in other words better for them. Truly God is Aware of what they do with their gazes and private parts and He will requite them for it.
Light,24,31,"And tell the believing women to lower their gaze and be modest, and to display of their adornment only that which is apparent, and to draw their veils over their bosoms, and not to reveal their adornment save to their own husbands or fathers or husbands’ fathers, or their sons or their husbands’ sons, or their brothers or their brothers’ sons or sisters’ sons, or their women, or their slaves, or male attendants who lack vigour, or children who know naught of women’s nakedness. And let them not stamp their feet so as to reveal what they hide of their adornment. And turn unto Allah together, O believers, in order that ye may succeed.",And tell believing women to lower their gaze away from what is not lawful for them to look at and to guard their private parts from what is not lawful for them to do with them and not to display their adornment except for what is apparent namely the face and the hands which may be seen by a stranger when there is no danger of either or both falling into temptation — this being one of two opinions. The second of these is that even this is forbidden because there is a presumption that these parts will cause temptation — and this is the preferred opinion if one must settle this topic with a definitive opinion; and let them draw their veils over their bosoms that is let them cover up their heads necks and chests with veils and not reveal their hidden adornment namely all that is other than the face and the hands except to their husbands bu‘ūl is the plural form of ba‘l ‘male spouse’ or their fathers or their husbands’ fathers or their sons or their husbands’ sons or their brothers or their brothers’ sons or their sisters’ sons or their women or what their right hands own all of whom are permitted to look thereat except for the part from the navel down to the knees which is unlawful for any other than their husbands to see; ‘their women’ however excludes disbelieving women for it is not permitted for Muslim women to reveal themselves to these; ‘what their right hands own’ comprises slaves; or such men who are dependant on what food may be left over not ghayri read as an adjective or read ghayra as an exceptive possessing any sexual desire not those men who are in sexual need of women so for example those whose male member cannot become erect; or children who are not yet aware of women’s private parts in the context of sexual intercourse and so to these they may reveal themselves except for that part from the navel to the knees. And do not let them thump with their feet to make known their hidden ornaments as in a rattling anklet and the like. And rally to God in repentance O believers repenting of the occasions on which you may have looked at what is forbidden to look at of such parts and otherwise so that you might be prosperous so that you might be saved from such sinful acts when your repentance thereof is accepted — in this verse the prevalent address is to males over females.
Light,24,32,"And marry such of you as are solitary and the pious of your slaves and maid-servants. If they be poor, Allah will enrich them of His bounty. Allah is of ample means, Aware.",And marry off the spouseless among you ayāmā is the plural form of ayyim namely a spouseless female whether she be a virgin or one previously married or a spouseless male this stipulation relates to free men and free women and the righteous ones the believers among your male slaves and your female slaves ‘ibād is one plural form of ‘abd. If they the free men are poor God will enrich them through marriage out of His bounty. God is Embracing of the needs of His creatures Knowing of them.
Light,24,33,"And let those who cannot find a match keep chaste till Allah give them independence by His grace. And such of your slaves as seek a writing (of emancipation), write it for them if ye are aware of aught of good in them, and bestow upon them of the wealth of Allah which He hath bestowed upon you. Force not your slave-girls to whoredom that ye may seek enjoyment of the life of the world, if they would preserve their chastity. And if one force them, then (unto them), after their compulsion, lo! Allah will be Forgiving, Merciful.",And let those who cannot find the means to marry be continent those who do not have the bridal money or the means for financial support needed for marriage let them restrain themselves from fornication until God enriches them until He improves their means out of His bounty and they marry. And those who seek a written contract of emancipation from among those whom your right hand owns of male slaves and female slaves contract with them accordingly if you know in them any good such as trustworthiness and the ability to earn income in order to fulfil the amount stated in the written contract which might be worded for example thus ‘I contract you for the amount of two thousand to be paid over a period of two months at one thousand a month and if you fulfill this you are a free man’ and the other would say ‘I accept’; and give them — this is a command for the slaves’ owners — out of the wealth of God which He has given you in the measure that will help them to fulfill their commitment to you the action of ītā’ ‘giving’ here suggests that some of the amount to which they have committed themselves should be waived. And do not compel your slave-girls your handmaidens to prostitution fornication when they desire to be chaste to abstain therefrom this ‘desire’ is the cause of the act of ‘compulsion’ so that the statement is not properly a conditional that you may seek through such compulsion the transient things of the life of this world — this was revealed regarding ‘Abd Allāh b. Ubayy who used to force his slave-girls to earn money through fornication. And should anyone compel them then surely God after their compulsion will be Forgiving to these slave-girls Merciful to them.
Light,24,34,"And verily We have sent down for you revelations that make plain, and the example of those who passed away before you. An admonition unto those who ward off (evil).",And verily We have revealed to you clear verses read mubayyanāt or mubayyināt in this sūra verses in which if read mubayyanāt what is mentioned is already clear or which if read mubayyināt are clarificatory of that which is mentioned and an example a curious tale namely that of ‘Ā’isha of those who passed away before you that is to say of their kind of example that is an example of their curious tales such as the tales of Joseph and Mary and an admonition for those who fear God in what He exalted be He has said And do not let any pity for them overcome you in God’s religion verse 2 above; and Why when you first heard about it did the believing men and women not think good of themselves… to the end of verse 12 above; and And why when you heard it did you not say … to the end of verse 16 above; and God admonishes you lest you should ever repeat the like of it … to the end of verse 17 above. This admonition is specifically for ‘those who fear God’ because they are the ones to benefit from such an admonition.

The lamp is in a glass — this glass is the case for the lantern and the misbāh is the torch that is the wick that is lit; al-mishkāt is a recess that does not penetrate to the other side in other words the tube inside the lantern the glass with the light inside it is as it were a glittering star that is a light-giving star read dirrī’un or durrī’un derived from al-dar‘ ‘to repel’ because it repels darkness; or read durriyyun derived from al-durr ‘pearls’ kindled is this lamp read past tense tawaqqada; a variant reading has the imperfect tense of awqada in the passive voice yūqadu; another reading has tūqadu in which case the reference is to al-zujāja ‘the glass’ from the oil of a Blessed Tree an olive neither of the east nor of the west but in between the two so that no harmful cold or heat affects it; whose oil would almost glow forth of itself though no fire touched it because of the extent of its purity. Light by Him upon light by fire; the light of God is His guidance of the believer light upon the light of faith. God guides to His Light that is to the religion of Islam whom He will. And God strikes He illustrates similitudes for men by approximating such similitudes to their comprehension so that they might take heed and believe; and God is Knower of all things including knowledge of how to strike similitudes.
Light,24,36,(This lamp is found) in houses which Allah hath allowed to be exalted and that His name shall be remembered therein. Therein do offer praise to Him at morn and evening.,In houses fī buyūtin is semantically connected to yusabbihu ‘glorify’ that will follow whose status God has allowed to be raised houses He has allowed to be venerated and wherein His Name is remembered through the affirmation of His Oneness therein they make glorifications read yusabbahu ‘glorifications are made’ or yusabbihu meaning ‘therein pray’ to Him in the mornings al-ghuduww is a verbal noun meaning al-ghadawāt ‘the early mornings’ and the evenings the darkness after sunset
Light,24,37,Men whom neither merchandise nor sale beguileth from remembrance of Allah and constancy in prayer and paying to the poor their due; who fear a day when hearts and eyeballs will be overturned;,men rijālun the subject of the verb yusabbihu ‘make glorifications’; if the passive is read yusabbahu ‘glorifications are made’ it rijālun ‘men’ substitutes for the impersonal subject of lahu ‘to Him’ so that rijālun ‘men’ is the subject of an implied verb in response to an implied question as if one had asked who makes glorifications to Him? whom neither trading purchase nor sale distracts from the remembrance of God and the observance of prayer the final hā’ of iqāmat ‘the observance’ has been omitted to facilitate the reading and payment of the alms. They fear a day when hearts and eyes will be tossed about in fear the hearts tossed about between the hope of deliverance and the fear of destruction and the eyes to the right and to the left out of anxiety — this is the Day of Resurrection;
Light,24,38,"That Allah may reward them with the best of what they did, and increase reward for them of His bounty. Allah giveth blessings without stint to whom He will.",so that God may reward them for the best of what they did that is reward them the reward for it ahsana means husna and give them more out of His bounty; and God provides whomever He will without any reckoning one says of someone yunfiqu bi-ghayri hisābin to mean that such a person is so generous that it is as though he does not need to reckon what he spends.
Light,24,39,"As for those who disbelieve, their deeds are as a mirage in a desert. The thirsty one supposeth it to be water till he cometh unto it and findeth it naught, and findeth, in the place thereof, Allah Who payeth him his due; and Allah is swift at reckoning.",And as for those who disbelieve their works are like a mirage in a plain qī‘a is the plural of qā‘ that is to say fulāt ‘an open space’. A mirage is a kind of radiation which one might observe therein at midday during extreme heat resembling running water — which the thirsty man supposes to be water until he comes to it and finds it to be nothing like what he had supposed. Likewise is the case of the disbeliever who supposes that his deeds such as some voluntary alms will benefit him; but when he dies and comes before his Lord he will not find his deed in other words it will be of no benefit to him; and he finds God there namely in the place of his deeds Who pays him his account in full that is He requites him for it in this world; and God is swift at reckoning that is at requiting.
Light,24,40,"Or as darkness on a vast, abysmal sea. There covereth him a wave, above which is a wave, above which is a cloud. Layer upon layer of darkness. When he holdeth out his hand he scarce can see it. And he for whom Allah hath not appointed light, for him there is no light.",Or it is that those who disbelieve their evil deeds are as the manifold darkness on a deep sea covered by a billow above which that is above which billow there is another billow above which second billow there are clouds these being the manifold layers of darkness one on top of another the darkness of the sea the darkness of the first billow the darkness of the second together with the darkness of the clouds. When he an observer holds out his hand in such layers of darkness he can scarcely see it in other words he would not even come close to seeing it. And he whom God has not granted any light has no light that is to say he whom God does not guide cannot be guided.
Light,24,41,"Hast thou not seen that Allah, He it is Whom all who are in the heavens and the earth praise, and the birds in their flight ? Of each He knoweth verily the worship and the praise; and Allah is Aware of what they do.",Have you not seen that God is glorified by all who are in the heavens and the earth prayer being one form of glorification and the birds tayr is the plural of tā’ir between the heaven and the earth spreading their wings? sāffātin is a circumstantial qualifier. Of each one of them He God verily knows its prayer and its glorification; and God knows what they do — the statement is predominantly directed to rational beings.
Light,24,42,"And unto Allah belongeth the Sovereignty of the heavens and the earth, and unto Allah is the journeying.",And to God belongs the kingdom of the heavens and the earth the treasuries of rain provision and vegetation and with God is the journey’s end the final return.
Light,24,43,"Hast thou not seen how Allah wafteth the clouds, then gathereth them, then maketh them layers, and thou seest the rain come forth from between them; He sendeth down from the heaven mountains wherein is hail, and smiteth therewith whom He will, and averteth it from whom He will. The flashing of His lightning all but snatcheth away the sight.",Have you not seen how God drives the clouds moves them along gently then composes them joining some with others and making scattered pieces as one then piles them up some on top of others whereat you see the rain issuing from the midst of them from specific outlets in them? And He sends down from the heaven out of the mountains min jibālin min is extra that are therein in the heaven fīhā substitutes for mina’l-samā’i ‘from the heaven’ with the repetition of a genitive preposition hail that is He sends down some hail and smites with it whom He will and turns it away from whom He will. The brilliance of its lightning its flashing would almost take away the eyes that look at it in other words it would almost snatching them away.
Light,24,44,Allah causeth the revolution of the day and the night. Lo! herein is indeed a lesson for those who see.,God alternates the night and the day that is He brings one in place of the other. Surely in that alternation there is a lesson an indication for those who see those possessing insight an indication of God’s power exalted be He.
Light,24,45,Allah hath created every animal of water. Of them is (a kind) that goeth upon its belly and (a kind) that goeth upon two legs and (a kind) that goeth upon four. Allah createth what He will. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.,And God has created every beast that is every animal from fluid from a sperm-drop. Among them are some that creep upon their bellies such as snakes and reptiles and among them are some that walk on two feet such as human beings and birds and among them are some that walk on four such as four-legged beasts and cattle. God creates whatever He will. Truly God has power over all things.
Light,24,46,Verily We have sent down revelations and explained them. Allah guideth whom He will unto a straight path.,And verily We have revealed manifest signs namely the Qur’ān; and God guides whomever He will to a straight path a straight route and that is the religion of Islam.
Light,24,47,"And they say: We believe in Allah and the messenger, and we obey; then after that a faction of them turn away. Such are not believers.",And they the hypocrites say ‘We believe in we affirm the truth of God of His Oneness and the Messenger Muhammad (s) and we obey’ them in what rulings they God and Muhammad give. Then after that a party of them turn away they are averse to it and those those who are averse they are not believers as believers should be believers whose hearts agree with the words of their tongues.
Light,24,48,"And when they appeal unto Allah and His messenger to judge between them, lo! a faction of them are averse;",And when they are summoned to God and His Messenger who conveys His words that he may judge between them behold a party of them are averse to come to him.
Light,24,49,But if right had been with them they would have come unto him willingly.,But if right be on their side they would come to him willingly hastening compliantly.
Light,24,50,"Is there in their hearts a disease, or have they doubts, or fear they lest Allah and His messenger should wrong them in judgment ? Nay, but such are evil-doers.",Is there a sickness disbelief in their hearts? Or are they in doubt are they uncertain of his prophethood or do they fear that God and His Messenger will be unjust to them? in judgement in other words that they will be wronged therein? No! Rather those they are the wrongdoers for shunning him.
Light,24,51,The saying of (all true) believers when they appeal unto Allah and His messenger to judge between them is only that they say: We hear and we obey. And such are the successful.,All that the believers say when they are summoned to God and His Messenger that he may judge between them is that they say in other words the saying that befits them is to say ‘We hear and we obey’ by responding to the summons. And those then are the successful the ones who will be saved.
Light,24,52,"He who obeyeth Allah and His messenger, and feareth Allah, and keepeth duty (unto Him): such indeed are the victorious.",And he who obeys God and His Messenger and fears God and fears Him read yattaqh or yattaqhi by being obedient to Him those they are the winners of Paradise.
Light,24,53,"They swear by Allah solemnly that, if thou order them, they will go forth. Say: Swear not; known obedience (is better). Lo! Allah is Informed of what ye do.",And they swear by God solemn oaths that if you order them to participate in the struggle they will surely go forth. Say to them ‘Do not swear! Acknowledged obedience to the Prophet is better than the oaths to which you are not true. Surely God is Aware of what you do’ when you say you will obey but act otherwise.
Light,24,54,"Say: Obey Allah and obey the messenger. But if ye turn away, then (it is) for him (to do) only that wherewith he hath been charged, and for you (to do) only that wherewith ye have been charged. If ye obey him, ye will go aright. But the messenger hath no other charge than to convey (the message) plainly.",Say ‘Obey God and obey the Messenger.’ But if you turn away from obedience to him tawallaw ‘you turn away’ one of the two tā’ letters in tatawallaw has been omitted; an address to them know that he is only responsible for that with which he has been charged of conveying the Message and you are responsible for that with which you have been charged of obedience to him. And if you obey him you will be rightly guided. And the Messenger’s duty is only to convey the Message clearly’.
Light,24,55,"Allah hath promised such of you as believe and do good work that He will surely make them to succeed (the present rulers) in the earth even as He caused those who were before them to succeed (others); and that He will surely establish for them their religion which He hath approved for them, and will give them in exchange safety after their fear. They serve Me. They ascribe no thing as partner unto Me. Those who disbelieve henceforth, they are the miscreants.",God has promised those of you who believe and perform righteous deeds that He will surely make them successors in the earth in place of the disbelievers just as He made those Children of Israel who were before them successors in place of the ruling tyrants the verb may be read as active istakhlafa ‘He made them successors’ or as passive istukhlifa ‘were made successors’ and He will surely establish for them their religion which He has approved for them namely the religion of Islam by making it prevail over all religions and enrich them throughout the land so that they become masters thereof and that He will give them in exchange read wa-la-yubdilannahum or wa-la-yubaddilannahum after their fear of disbelievers security. And God fulfilled His promise to them in the way mentioned and He praises them with His words ‘They worship Me without associating anything with Me’ ya‘budūnanī lā yushrikūna bī shay’an is an independent new sentence standing as a justification for His promise. And whoever is ungrateful after that bestowal of grace from among them whoever is ungrateful for it those they are the immoral. The first to show ingratitude for that grace of God were the murderers of ‘Uthmān b. ‘Affān may God be pleased with him and they began to kill one another henceforth after having been brothers.
Light,24,56,"Establish worship and pay the poor-due and obey the messenger, that haply ye may find mercy.",And establish prayer and pay the alms and obey the Messenger that perhaps you may find mercy that is to say do so hoping for mercy.
Light,24,57,Think not that the disbelievers can escape in the land.

Light,24,58,"O ye who believe! Let your slaves, and those of you who have not come to puberty, ask leave of you at three times (before they come into your presence): Before the prayer of dawn, and when ye lay aside your raiment for the heat of noon, and after the prayer of night. Three times of privacy for you. It is no sin for them or for you at other times, when some of you go round attendant upon others (if they come into your presence without leave). Thus Allah maketh clear the revelations for you. Allah is Knower, Wise.",O you who believe let those whom your right hands own of male slaves and female slaves and those of you who have not reached puberty from among the free men and who have not become sexually aware of women ask leave of you three times at three times of the day before the dawn prayer and when you put off your garments at noon and after the night prayer. These are three periods of privacy for you read thalāthu ‘awrātin lakum with nominative inflection as the predicate of an implied subject followed by a genitive annexation with the annexed term standing in place thereof of the predicate in other words the implied predicate followed by the annexation is hiya awqāt ‘these are times of …’; or read thalātha ‘awrātin lakum in the accusative the implication being that awqāta is itself in the accusative as a substitute for the syntactical status of what precedes it in place of which stands the annexed term. It is because clothes are taken off that private parts are revealed during such periods. Neither you nor they namely slaves and young boys would be at fault in entering upon you without asking leave at other times that is after the three times of day specified; they frequent you to provide service as some of you do with others this sentence corroborates the preceding one. So just as He has clarified what has been mentioned God clarifies for you the signs the rulings; and God is Knower of the affairs of His creatures Wise in what He has ordained for them. It is said that the ‘permission’ verse āyat al-isti’idhān was abrogated; but it is also said that it was not abrogated but that people thought little of neglecting to seek permission in such situations.

Allah is Knower, Wise.",And when the children among you O free men reach puberty let them seek permission at all times just as those now older free men sought permission before them. So God clarifies His signs for you and God is Knower Wise.
Light,24,60,"As for women past child-bearing, who have no hope of marriage, it is no sin for them if they discard their (outer) clothing in such a way as not to show adornment. But to refrain is better for them. Allah is Hearer, Knower.",And as for menopausal women who have ceased to menstruate or to bear children because of old age who do not expect to marry for that reason they would not be at fault if they put off their clothes such a robe a cloak or the facial mask over a head veil in such a way as not to display adornment that is hidden such as a necklace a bracelet or an anklet; but to refrain from doing so by not putting them off is better for them; and God is Hearer of what you say Knower of what is in your hearts.
Light,24,61,"No blame is there upon the blind nor any blame upon the lame nor any blame upon the sick nor on yourselves if ye eat from your houses, or the houses of your fathers, or the houses of your mothers, or the houses of your brothers, or the houses of your sisters, or the houses of your fathers’ brothers, or the houses of your fathers’ sisters, or the houses of your mothers’ brothers, or the houses of your mothers’ sisters, or (from that) whereof ye hold the keys, or (from the house) of a friend.

Thus Allah maketh clear His revelations for you, that haply ye may understand.",There is no blame upon the blind nor any blame upon the lame nor any blame upon the sick that they be one’s table companions nor any blame upon yourselves if you eat from your own houses that is from the houses of your offspring or your fathers’ houses or your mothers’ houses or your brothers’ houses or your sisters’ houses or the houses of your paternal uncles or the houses of your paternal aunts or the houses of your maternal uncles or the houses of your maternal aunts or from that whereof you hold the keys from that which you safeguard on behalf of others or from those of your faithful friends sadīq is so called because he is ‘faithful’ sadaqa to you in his affection. In other words one is permitted to eat from the houses of those mentioned even if they are not present provided that they consent to it. You would not be at fault whether you eat together in a group or separately individually ashtāt is the plural of shatt. This was revealed concerning those who felt inhibited about eating alone and who when they could not find a table companion they would refrain from eating. But when you enter houses that are yours houses wherein there is no one bid peace to yourselves say ‘Peace be upon us and upon God’s righteous servants’ for the angels will return your greeting; and if there is family therein bid peace to them with a salutation tahiyyatan is the verbal noun from hayyā ‘he saluted’ from God blessed and good and for which one is rewarded. So God clarifies the signs for you that is to say He sets out for you in detail the ritual ceremonies of your religion that perhaps you might comprehend in order for you to understand this.

Verily God knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously that is those who leave the mosque secretly during the sermon without asking leave hiding behind something qad ‘verily’ is for confirmation. So let those who contravene His command that is God’s command or that of His Messenger beware lest an ordeal a trial befall them or there befall them a painful chastisement in the Hereafter.
Light,24,64,Lo! verily unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. He knoweth your condition.

Allah is Knower of all things.,Lo! surely to God belongs all that is in the heavens and the earth by way of possession creation and servitude. He is ever aware of how you O you who are obligated to the prescriptions of the Law are behaving with regard to faith or hypocrisy and He knows the day when they shall be returned to Him there is a shift here from the second person address to that of the third person in other words He knows when this day will be — He will inform them thereupon of what they did of good and evil and God is Knower of all things which they do and otherwise.

The Poets,26,22,And this is the past favour wherewith thou reproachest me: that thou hast enslaved the Children of Israel.,That is a favour with which you now reproach me that you have enslaved the Children of Israel’ an ‘abbadta banī Isrā’īl is explicative of tilka ‘that’ in other words you have enslaved them but not me there is no favour in that for your enslavement of them is wrong some scholars have reckoned there to be an interrogative hamza of denial at the beginning of this verse a-tilka ni‘matun ‘is that a favour?’.
The Poets,26,23,Pharaoh said: And what is the Lord of the Worlds ?,Pharaoh said to Moses ‘And what is “the Lord of the Worlds” ’ the One Whose Messenger you say you indeed are? In other words what exactly is He? And since there is no way for creation to know the true nature of God but only to know Him through an articulation of His attributes Moses blessings and peace be upon him responds to him with mention of some of these attributes
The Poets,26,24,"(Moses) said: Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them, if ye had but sure belief.",He said ‘The Lord of the heavens and the earth and all that is between them in other words the Creator of all that — should you have conviction’ that He exalted be He is their Creator then believe in Him alone.
The Poets,26,25,(Pharaoh) said unto those around him: Hear ye not ?,He Pharaoh said to those noblemen among his folk who were around him ‘Did you not hear?!’ his response how it does not correspond to the question I asked?
The Poets,26,26,He said: Your Lord and the Lord of your fathers.,He Moses said ‘Your Lord and the Lord of your forefathers’. Now even though this fact is comprised by what was said before it enrages Pharaoh and therefore
The Poets,26,27,(Pharaoh) said: Lo! your messenger who hath been sent unto you is indeed a madman!,He said ‘Verily this messenger of yours sent to you is a madman!’
The Poets,26,28,"He said: Lord of the East and the West and all that is between them, if ye did but understand.",He Moses said ‘The Lord of the east and the west and all that is between them — should you comprehend’ that He is such a Lord then believe in Him alone.
The Poets,26,29,"(Pharaoh) said: If thou choosest a god other than me, I assuredly shall place thee among the prisoners.",He Pharaoh said to Moses ‘If you choose any god other than me I will surely make you a prisoner!’. His Pharaoh’s prison was very harsh for a person would be shut up in a dungeon underground alone where he could neither see nor hear anyone else.
The Poets,26,30,He said: Even though I show thee something plain ?,He Moses said to him ‘What would you do this even if I bring you something manifest?’ patent proof of my Mission?

The Poets,26,37,Who shall bring unto thee every knowing wizard.,to bring you every cunning sorcerer’ to surpass Moses in the art of magic.

The Poets,26,39,And it was said unto the people: Are ye (also) gathering ?,And it was said to the people ‘Will you assemble!’
The Poets,26,40,"(They said): Aye, so that we may follow the wizards if they are the winners.",Maybe we will follow the sorcerers should they be the victors’ the interrogative of the previous verse is an incitement to assemble and the optative sense implicit in la‘alla is due to their anticipation of victory and hence their continued adherence to their religion and rejection of Moses.
The Poets,26,41,And when the wizards came they said unto Pharaoh: Will there surely be a reward for us if we are the winners ?,So when the sorcerers came they said to Pharaoh ‘Shall we indeed read a-inna either by pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second but in both cases inserting an alif have a reward if we were to be the victors?’
The Poets,26,42,"He said: Aye, and ye will then surely be of those brought near (to me).",He said ‘Yes of course! And you shall then be among those closest to me’.

The Poets,26,47,"Crying: We believe in the Lord of the Worlds,",They said ‘We believe in the Lord of the Worlds
The Poets,26,48,The Lord of Moses and Aaron.,the Lord of Moses and Aaron’ for they realised that what they had witnessed in the case of the staff could not have been the result of mere sorcery.

Verily I will cut off your hands and your feet alternately, and verily I will crucify you every one.",Pharaoh said ‘Do you believe a-āmantum read pronouncing both hamzas or replacing the second one with an alif him Moses though I have not given you leave? He is indeed your chief the one who has taught you sorcery — so that he only taught you some tricks and then surpassed you with others. Soon you will know what I will do with you! I will assuredly cut off your hands and legs on opposite sides — in other words the right hand of each one together with his left leg — then I shall surely crucify you all.’

The Poets,26,56,And lo! we are a ready host.,and indeed we are all on our guard’ ready a variant reading for hadhirūna has hādhirūn meaning ‘alert’.

The Poets,26,59,Thus (were those things taken from them) and We caused the Children of Israel to inherit them.,So it was that is Our expulsion of them was as We have described and We made the Children of Israel to inherit these after drowning Pharaoh and his folk.
The Poets,26,60,And they overtook them at sunrise.,Then they pursued them they caught them up at sunrise.

The Ant,27,19,"And (Solomon) smiled, laughing at her speech, and said: My Lord, arouse me to be thankful for Thy favour wherewith Thou hast favoured me and my parents, and to do good that shall be pleasing unto Thee, and include me in (the number of) Thy righteous slaves.",Whereat he Solomon smiled fa-tabassama the beginning of the sentence amused dāhikan the end of the sentence at its words which he had heard from three miles away and which was carried to him by the winds. When he was on the verge of entering their valley he Solomon made his hosts halt until they the ants had entered their dwellings — on this journey his hosts consisted of cavalry and infantry. And he said ‘My Lord inspire me to be thankful for Your grace with which You have favoured me and my parents and to do good that will please You and include me by Your mercy among Your righteous servants’ the prophets and saints.
The Ant,27,20,"And he sought among the birds and said: How is it that I see not the hoopoe, or is he among the absent ?",And he reviewed the birds to see the hoopoe — which would locate water beneath the ground and indicate its location by pecking at it whereupon the devils would extract it for Solomon required it for when he prayed; but he could not see him — then he said ‘Why is it that I do not see the hoopoe? in other words is there something preventing me from seeing him? Or is he among the absent? and so I cannot see him because he is absent?’ And when he became certain of the hoopoe’s absence
The Ant,27,21,"I verily will punish him with hard punishment or I verily will slay him, or he verily shall bring me a plain excuse.",He said ‘Assuredly I will chastise him with a severe chastisement by having all his feathers as well as his tail plucked and leaving him out in the sun where he would not be able to escape from reptiles or I will slaughter him by slitting his throat unless he brings me read la-ya’tiyannī or la-ya’tinannī a clear warrant’ plain manifest proof for his having a valid excuse.
The Ant,27,22,"But he was not long in coming, and he said: I have found out (a thing) that thou apprehendest not, and I come unto thee from Sheba with sure tidings.",But he did not remain read fa-makutha or fa-makatha long in absence in other words he was away only for a short while and came to Solomon humbly with his head up and his wings and tail lowered. Solomon pardoned him and asked him about what he had encountered during his absence and he said ‘I have discovered something of which you have no knowledge and I have brought you from Sheba this may be read in declined form min Saba’in or left as indeclinable min Saba’a — a tribe in Yemen whose name is taken from the name of one of their ancestors which is also the reason why it may be declined — a verified report.
The Ant,27,23,"Lo! I found a woman ruling over them, and she hath been given (abundance) of all things, and hers is a mighty throne.",I found a woman ruling over them in other words she was their queen her name Bilqīs; and she has been given an abundance of all things that kings might require in the way of machines and instruments and she possesses a great throne — its length was 80 cubits its width 40 cubits its height 30 cubits and was made of gold and silver encrusted with pearls rubies chrysolite and emeralds with its legs made of rubies chrysolite and emeralds containing seven inner doors the door of each chamber shut.
The Ant,27,24,"I found her and her people worshipping the sun instead of Allah; and Satan maketh their works fairseeming unto them, and debarreth them from the way (of Truth), so that they go not aright;",I found her and her people prostrating to the sun instead of God and Satan has adorned for them their deeds and he has barred them from the Way from the path of truth so that they are not guided
The Ant,27,25,"So that they worship not Allah, Who bringeth forth the hidden in the heavens and the earth, and knoweth what ye hide and what ye proclaim,",to prostrate themselves to God allā yasjudū should be read as an yasjudū the lā is extra and with it has been assimilated the nūn of an similar to the construction where God says li-allā ya‘lama ahlu’l-kitābi so that the People of the Scripture may know Q. 5729; the sentence functions as the direct object of yahtadūna ‘guided’ whose ilā ‘to’ has been omitted; He Who brings forth the hidden al-khab’ is a verbal noun with the same meaning as al-makhbū’ ‘that which is hidden’ of rain and plants in the heavens and the earth and He knows what they conceal within their hearts and what they proclaim with their tongues.
The Ant,27,26,"Allah; there is no God save Him, the Lord of the Tremendous Throne.",God — there is no god except Him the Lord of the Mighty Throne’ this clause constitutes an independent new sentence which is a eulogy comprising praise of the Throne of the Compassionate One to counter the description of the throne of Bilqīs between the two however is an unfathomable difference.
The Ant,27,27,(Solomon) said: We shall see whether thou speakest truth or whether thou art of the liars.,He Solomon said to the hoopoe ‘We shall see whether you have spoken the truth in what you have informed us or whether you are of the liars that is of their ilk — for to say that is rhetorically more powerful than simply saying ‘or whether you have lied’. He the hoopoe indicated to them the place of the water and it was extracted. They thus drank performed their ablutions and prayed. Solomon then composed a letter in the following form ‘From the servant of God Solomon son of David to Bilqīs Queen of Sheba. In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful Peace be upon those who follow Guidance. To wit do not rise up against me in defiance but come to me in submission’. He then stamped it with musk and sealed it with his ring and said to the hoopoe
The Ant,27,28,"Go with this my letter and throw it down unto them; then turn away and see what (answer) they return,",Take this letter of mine and deliver it to them that is to Bilqīs and her people then turn away withdraw from them but remain close by them and see what response they shall return’ and see what kind of response they shall give. Thus he took it and approached her Bilqīs. But as her soldiers were all around her he cast it into her private chamber. When she saw it she shuddered and was consumed by fear. She read what it said.
The Ant,27,29,(The Queen of Sheba) said (when she received the letter): O chieftains! Lo! there hath been thrown unto me a noble letter.,Then she said to the noblemen of her people ‘O members of the council lo! read yā ayyuhā’l-mala’u innī pronouncing in the last two words both hamzas; or by not pronouncing the second one and changing it into a wāw with kasra vowelling a noble a sealed letter has been delivered to me.
The Ant,27,30,"Lo! it is from Solomon, and lo! it is: In the name of Allah, the Beneficent, the Merciful;",It is from Solomon and lo! it is in other words its text says “In the Name of God the Compassionate the Merciful.
The Ant,27,31,"Exalt not yourselves against me, but come unto me as those who surrender.",Do not rise up against me in defiance but come to me in submission”’.
The Ant,27,32,She said: O chieftains! Pronounce for me in my case. I decide no case till ye are present with me.,She said ‘O members of the council give me an opinion read yā ayyuhā’l-mala’u aftūnī pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second and changing it into a wāw in other words guide me in this matter of mine. I never decide on a matter I never conclude it until you are present’.
The Ant,27,33,"They said: We are lords of might and lords of great prowess, but it is for thee to command; so consider what thou wilt command.",They said ‘We possess force and we possess great might in other words we are hardy in war. The matter is for you to decide. So see what you will command’ us and we will obey you.
The Ant,27,34,"She said: Lo! kings, when they enter a township, ruin it and make the honour of its people shame. Thus will they do.",She said ‘Indeed kings when they enter a town ruin it with destruction and reduce the mightiest of its inhabitants to the most abased. That is what they too will do namely the senders of this letter.
The Ant,27,35,"But lo! I am going to send a present unto them, and to see with what (answer) the messengers return.",Now I will send them a gift and wait to see with what response the envoys return’ in the way of accepting the gift or rejecting it. If it be a king to whom we have sent it he will accept it; but if it be a prophet he will reject it. Thus she sent male and female servants one thousand in total together with five hundred bricks of gold a crown studded with jewels and musk ambergris and other things with an envoy carrying a letter. The hoopoe thus hurried back to bring the news to Solomon who ordered bricks of gold and silver to be made and laid out across a vast square the distance of nine parasangs from his seat and for a towering wall of gold and silver to be constructed around it and for the most splendid creatures of the land and the sea together with the children of the jinn to be brought to line the right and left sides of the square.
The Ant,27,36,"So when (the envoy) came unto Solomon, (the King) said: What! Would ye help me with wealth ? But that which Allah hath given me is better than that which He hath given you. Nay it is ye (and not I) who exult in your gift.",But when he the envoy came to Solomon with the gift and the servants he said ‘Are you supplying me with wealth? What God has given me of prophethood and kingship is better than what He has given you of the things of this world. Nay but it is you and not I who exult in your gift for you pride yourselves upon the possession of the ornaments of this world!
The Ant,27,37,"Return unto them. We verily shall come unto them with hosts that they cannot resist, and we shall drive them out from thence with shame, and they will be abased.",Go back to them with the gifts that you have brought for We shall assuredly come to them with hosts which they will not be able to face and we shall expel them from there from the land of Sheba Saba’ — named thus after their tribal ancestor — humiliated and they shall be utterly abased’ unless they come to me in submission. When the envoy returned to her with the gift she had her throne placed inside seven doors inside her palace with her palace inside seven palaces and had all the doors locked with guards at them. She then prepared to make the journey to Solomon to see what he would command her. She departed with twelve thousand chieftains qayl each accompanied by thousands of men until when she came to within a parasang of him he sensed her arrival.
The Ant,27,38,"He said: O chiefs! Which of you will bring me her throne before they come unto me, surrendering ?",He said ‘O members of the council which of you regarding the two hamzas read them in the way mentioned above verse 32 will bring me her throne before they come to me in submission?’ compliant and obedient? For I may only rightfully seize it before this submission and not afterwards.
The Ant,27,39,A stalwart of the jinn said: I will bring it thee before thou canst rise from thy place. Lo! I verily am strong and trusty for such work.,An afreet from among the jinn — a jinn who is powerful and stalwart — said ‘I will bring it to you before you rise from your place the one in which you sit when adjudicating — the period from morning to midday. Indeed I have the strength for it that is for carrying it and I am trustworthy’ over what it may contain of jewels and other precious things. Solomon said ‘I want something faster than that!’
The Ant,27,40,"One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: I will bring it thee before thy gaze returneth unto thee. And when he saw it set in his presence, (Solomon) said: This is of the bounty of my Lord, that He may try me whether I give thanks or am ungrateful. Whosoever giveth thanks he only giveth thanks for (the good of) his own soul; and whosoever is ungrateful (is ungrateful only to his own soul’s hurt). For lo! my Lord is Absolute in independence, Bountiful.",The one who had knowledge of the revealed Scripture — and this was one Āsif b. Barkhiyā a righteous individual with knowledge of God’s Greatest Name which when invoked in supplication for something it is immediately granted — said ‘I will bring it to you before your glance returns to you after you look at something. So he the afreet said to him ‘Look up towards the heaven’ which he did and when his glance returned in front of him he found it Bilqīs’ throne placed before him — for in the instance in which Solomon looked up to the heaven Āsif supplicated by invoking the Greatest Name that God bring it thereto; and this was done by having it travel under the earth until it sprung up below Solomon’s seat kursī. Then when he saw it standing still before him he said ‘This bringing it to me is of my Lord’s bounty that He may try me test me whether I give thanks read a-ashkur pronouncing both hamzas; or by replacing the second one with an alif; or by not pronouncing the second one but inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one or without the insertion or am ungrateful for the favour. And whoever gives thanks gives thanks only for his own sake because the reward for his thanks shall be his and whoever is ungrateful for the favour should know then my Lord is surely Independent with no need of his thanks Generous’ by being bounteous to those who are ungrateful for it.
The Ant,27,41,He said: Disguise her throne for her that we may see whether she will go aright or be of those not rightly guided.,He said ‘Disguise her throne for her — in other words transform it such that when she sees it it will be in an unrecognisable form — that we may see whether she will be guided to recognising it or be of those who cannot be guided’ to recognise when things are transformed around them. He Solomon sought thereby to test her mind for it was said to have something wrong with it. Thus they transformed it by adding or taking away certain things and in other ways.
The Ant,27,42,"So, when she came, it was said (unto her): Is thy throne like this ? She said: (It is) as though it were the very one. And (Solomon said): We were given the knowledge before her and we had surrendered (to Allah).",So when she came it was said to her ‘Is your throne like this?’ She said ‘It as though it is the one’. She had in fact recognised it; but she made a pretence to them just as they made a pretence to her given that when she was asked about the throne it was not said ‘Is this your throne?’ for had it been so she would have replied ‘Yes it is’. When Solomon realised that she was perceptive and knowledgeable he said ‘And we were given the knowledge before her and we had submitted to God.
The Ant,27,43,"And (all) that she was wont to worship instead of Allah hindered her, for she came of disbelieving folk.",And what she worshipped besides God that is other than Him barred her from the worship of God for she belonged to disbelieving folk’.
The Ant,27,44,"It was said unto her: Enter the hall. And when she saw it she deemed it a pool and bared her legs. (Solomon) said: Lo! it is a hall, made smooth, of glass. She said: My Lord! Lo! I have wronged myself, and I surrender with Solomon unto Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.",It was also said to her ‘Enter the palace hallway’ — this was a transparent white glass floor underneath which flowed sweet water that contained fish. Solomon had it made when he was told that her legs and feet resembled the shanks of a mule. And when she saw it she supposed it to be a pool of water and so she bared her legs to wade through it. Meanwhile Solomon was seated on his throne at the front part of the palace hallway and he saw that her legs and feet were in fact fair. He said to her ‘It is a hallway paved smooth with crystal’ and thereafter he called her to submit to God. She said ‘My Lord indeed I have wronged myself by worshipping other than You and I submit with Solomon to God the Lord of the Worlds’. He wanted to marry her but disliked the hair on her legs. So the devils made a depilatory lime mixture nūra and she removed it therewith. He married her and had great love for her. And he let her remain as ruler of her kingdom and would visit her once a month staying for three days every time. Her reign came to an end at the same time as that of Solomon. It is reported that he became king at the age of 13 and died at the age of 53 — Glory be to the One whose enduring sovereignty will never end!
The Ant,27,45,"And We verily sent unto Thamud their brother Salih, saying: Worship Allah. And lo! they (then became two parties quarrelling.",And verily We sent to Thamūd their brother in terms of his belonging to the same tribe Sālih with the following decree ‘Worship God!’ affirm His Oneness. And lo! they then became two parties quarrelling with one another over religion one party having become believers upon his arrival as messenger to them and the other party disbelievers.
The Ant,27,46,"He said: O my people! Why will ye hasten on the evil rather than the good ? Why will ye not ask pardon of Allah, that ye may receive mercy.",He said to the deniers ‘O my people why do you seek to hasten on evil before seeking good? in other words why do you seek to hasten on chastisement instead of mercy when you say ‘If what you bring us is true then bring us the chastisement!’ Why do you not ask God to forgive you your idolatry so that you might be shown mercy?’ and not be chastised.
The Ant,27,47,"They said: We augur evil of thee and those with thee. He said: Your evil augury is with Allah. Nay, but ye are folk that are being tested.",They said ‘We augur evil ittayyarnā is actually tatayyarnā but the tā’ has been assimilated with the tā’ and a conjunctive hamza added of you and of those who are with you’ namely the believers — when they the tribe of Thamūd were deprived of rain and suffered hunger. He said ‘Your evil augury is with God — He has given it to you; nay but you are a people being tried’ being tested with good and evil turns of fortune.
The Ant,27,48,And there were in the city nine persons who made mischief in the land and reformed not.,And there were in the city the city of Thamūd a band of nine men that is nine men who were causing corruption in the land with acts of disobedience which included their corroding of dinar and dirham coins rendering them worthless and did not reform their ways through obedience to God.
The Ant,27,49,"They said: Swear one to another by Allah that we verily will attack him and his household by night, and afterward we will surely say unto his friend: We witnessed not the destruction of his household. And lo! we are truthtellers.",They said that is some said to others ‘Swear to one another by God that we will attack him by night la-nubayyitannahu; or read la-tubayyitunnahu ‘that you will attack him by night’ together with his folk that is those who believed in him in other words swear that we will kill them at night; then we will surely say la-naqūlanna; or read la-taqūlunna ‘you surely will say’ to his heir the avenger of his blood that we did not witness we were not present at the destruction of his folk read muhlika or mahlika meaning ‘the destroying of them’ or ‘their death’ respectively and so we do not know who killed them and that indeed we are being truthful’.
The Ant,27,50,"So they plotted a plot: and We plotted a plot, while they perceived not.",So they plotted thereby a plot but We also plotted a plot in other words We requited them by hastening on their punishment while they were not aware.
The Ant,27,51,"Then see the nature of the consequence of their plotting, for lo! We destroyed them and their people, every one.",So behold how was the consequence of their plot! For lo! We destroyed them and all their people with Gabriel’s cry or by the angels’ pelting them with stones which they could see even though they could not see them the angels.
The Ant,27,52,"See, yonder are their dwellings empty and in ruins because they did wrong. Lo! herein is indeed a portent for a people who have knowledge.",So those then are their houses lying deserted khāwiyatan is in the accusative because it is a circumstantial qualifier the operator of which is the import of the demonstrative pronoun tilka ‘those’ because of the evil which they did that is their disbelief. Surely in that there is a sign a lesson for a people who have knowledge of Our power and are thus admonished.
The Ant,27,53,And we saved those who believed and used to ward off (evil).,And We delivered those who believed in Sālih — and they numbered 4000 — and were fearful of idolatry.
The Ant,27,54,And Lot! when he said unto his folk: Will ye commit abomination knowingly ?,And Lot Lūtan is in the accusative because of an implied udhkur ‘mention’ before it and it Lūtan is substituted by the following idh qāla … when he said to his people ‘What! Do you commit such abomination namely homosexual intercourse while you watch? that is to say while you watch one another so engrossed are you in the sinful act?
The Ant,27,55,"Must ye needs lust after men instead of women ? Nay, but ye are folk who act senselessly.",What! Do you read a-innakum pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second and inserting an alif between the two in both cases come unto men in lust instead of women? Nay but you are truly a people in ignorance’ of the consequence of your action.
The Ant,27,56,"But the answer of his folk was naught save that they said: Expel the household of Lot from your township, for they (forsooth) are folk who would keep clean!",But the only response of his people was that they said ‘Expel Lot’s family from your town. They are indeed a folk who prefer to remain pure!’ from coming unto the rears of men.
The Ant,27,57,Then We saved him and his household save his wife; We destined her to be of those who stayed behind.,So We delivered him and his family except his wife — We decreed for her We made her by Our decree to be of those who remained behind in the chastisement.
The Ant,27,58,And We rained a rain upon them. Dreadful is the rain of those who have been warned.,Then We rained on them a rain — these were the stones of baked mud cf. Q. 1574 — which destroyed them. And evil indeed was their rain the rain of those who were warned against chastisement.
The Ant,27,59,"Say (O Muhammad): Praise be to Allah, and peace be on His slaves whom He hath chosen! Is Allah best, or (all) that ye ascribe as partners (unto Him) ?",Say O Muhammad (s) ‘Praise be to God for the destruction of the disbelievers of past communities and peace be on His servants whom He has chosen’. Is God read a-Allāhu pronouncing both hamzas; or by substituting an alif for the second one; or by not pronouncing the second one but inserting an alif between the one not pronounced and the other one or without such an insertion better for those who worship Him or the partners which they ascribe? read either tushrikūna ‘you ascribe’ or yushrikūna ‘they ascribe’ they being the people of Mecca the partners they ascribe to Him in other words are such gods better for those who worship them?
The Ant,27,60,"Is not He (best) Who created the heavens and the earth, and sendeth down for you water from the sky wherewith We cause to spring forth joyous orchards, whose trees it never hath been yours to cause to grow. Is there any God beside Allah ? Nay, but they are folk who ascribe equals (unto Him)!",Or He Who created the heavens and the earth and sends down for you water from the heaven whereby We cause to grow there is a shift here from third person to that of the first person plural splendid gardens hadā’iq is the plural of hadīqa which is an enclosed garden whose trees you could never cause to grow? because of you do not have the ability for it. Is there a god a-ilāhun here and in the seven instances in which it occurs read by pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second inserting an alif between the two in both cases with God? who has helped Him in all of this? In other words there is no god with Him. Nay but they are a people who ascribe equals to Him who associate with God others.
The Ant,27,61,"Is not He (best) Who made the earth a fixed abode, and placed rivers in the folds thereof, and placed firm hills therein, and hath set a barrier between the two seas ? Is there any God beside Allah ? Nay, but most of them know not!",Or He Who made the earth an abode of stability that does not constantly shake beneath the feet of its inhabitants and made rivers to flow throughout it and set firm mountains for it with which He fixed the earth in place and set an isthmus between the two seas between the sweet one and the salty one the one not mixing with the other. Is there a god with God? Nay but most of them have no knowledge of His Oneness.
The Ant,27,62,"Is not He (best) Who answereth the wronged one when he crieth unto Him and removeth the evil, and hath made you viceroys of the earth ? Is there any God beside Allah ? Little do they reflect!",Or He Who answers the desperate one the anguished person suffering harm when he calls to Him and Who removes his distress from him and from others and makes you successors in the earth the annexation khulafā’a l-ardi ‘successors of the earth’ has the same meaning as fī ‘in’ khulafā’a fī’l-ardi ‘successors in the earth’ in other words each generation succeeding the one before it. Is there a god with God? Little do you remember little are you admonished read mā tadhakkarūna ‘do you remember’; or read yadhdhakkarūna ‘do they remember’ where in both cases the tā’ has been assimilated with the dhāl; the mā is extra used to make less what is already ‘little’.
The Ant,27,63,"Is not He (best) Who guideth you in the darkness of the land and the sea, He Who sendeth the winds as heralds of His mercy ? Is there any God beside Allah ? High Exalted be Allah from all that they ascribe as partner (unto Him)!",Or He Who guides you shows you the way to your destinations in the darkness of the land and the sea by the stars at night and by the various landmarks during the day and Who sends forth the winds as harbingers of His mercy ahead of the rain. Is there a god with God? Exalted be God high above what others they associate with Him!
The Ant,27,64,"Is not He (best) Who produceth creation, then reproduceth it, and Who provideth for you from the heaven and the earth ? Is there any God beside Allah ? Say: Bring your proof, if ye are truthful!",Or He Who originates creation in the wombs from a sperm-drop then brings it back again after death as established by the proofs for this resurrection even if you do not acknowledge it; and Who provides for you from the heaven rain and from the earth vegetation. Is there a god with God? In other words none of the things mentioned is done by anyone other than God and there is no god with Him. Say O Muhammad (s) ‘Produce your proof your definitive argument if you are truthful’ about their being a god with Me who has done any of the things mentioned.
The Ant,27,65,Say (O Muhammad): None in the heavens and the earth knoweth the Unseen save Allah; and they know not when they will be raised (again).,They the disbelievers also asked him when the Hour will come to pass and the following was revealed Say ‘No one in the heavens or the earth knows be it angels or human beings the Unseen namely what is hidden from them except God He knows it and they are not aware the disbelievers of Mecca like others when is the time in which they will be resurrected.
The Ant,27,66,"Nay, but doth their knowledge reach to the Hereafter ? Nay, for they are in doubt concerning it. Nay, for they cannot see it.",Nay has their knowledge come to comprise read adraka similar to the 4th verbal form akrama ‘he was kind to’; a variant reading has iddāraka which is actually tadāraka with the tā’ changed into a dāl and assimilated with the other dāl and a conjunctive hamza added meaning ‘attained’ or ‘caught up with’ the Hereafter? such that they have reason to ask about the time of its coming — not so Nay for they are in doubt of it. Rather they are blind to it ‘amūna ‘blind’ as in blindness of the heart; this statement is rhetorically more powerful than the preceding one; the origin of the term is ‘amiyūn but the damma vowel is deemed too heavy for the yā’ and has been moved to the mīm after dropping its kasra vowel.
The Ant,27,67,"Yet those who disbelieve say: When we have become dust like our fathers, shall we verily be brought forth (again) ?",And the disbelievers say also in rejecting the idea of resurrection ‘What! When we and our fathers are dust shall we indeed be brought forth again? from the graves.
The Ant,27,68,"We were promised this, forsooth, we and our fathers. (All) this is naught but fables of the men of old.",Already we and our fathers have been promised this before. But these are just the legendary fables of the ancients’ asātīr is the plural of ustūra meaning ‘what has been written down mā sutira of lies’.
The Ant,27,69,"Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Travel in the land and see the nature of the sequel for the guilty!",Say ‘Travel in the land and see how was the sequel for the criminals’ because of their denials — and this sequel is that they were destroyed with punishment.
The Ant,27,70,"And grieve thou not for them, nor be in distress because of what they plot (against thee).",And do not grieve for them and do not be distressed by their schemes — this is meant to comfort the Prophet s in other words do not be concerned with their plotting against you for We will grant you victory over them.
The Ant,27,71,"And they say: When (will) this promise (be fulfilled), if ye are truthful ?",And they say ‘When will this promise of chastisement be if you are truthful?’ regarding it.
The Ant,27,72,Say: It may be that a part of that which ye would hasten on is close behind you.,Say ‘It may be that part of what you seek to hasten on is close behind you’ — so they were slain at Badr and the remaining chastisement will come to them after death.
The Ant,27,73,"Lo! thy Lord is full of bounty for mankind, but most of them do not give thanks.",And surely your Lord is bountiful to mankind an example of which is His deferring chastisement for the disbelievers but most of them are not thankful — disbelievers are not grateful for the deferring of chastisement since they reject the fact that it will ever come to pass.
The Ant,27,74,"Lo! thy Lord knoweth surely all that their bosoms hide, and all that they proclaim.",And surely your Lord knows what their hearts conceal what these hide and what they proclaim by their tongues.
The Ant,27,75,And there is nothing hidden in the heaven or the earth but it is in a clear Record.,And there is not a thing hidden in the heaven and the earth the hā’ tā’ marbūta of ghā’ibatun is hyperbole in other words anything that is completely hidden from people but it is in a manifest Book namely in the Preserved Tablet al-lawh al-mahfūz and in God’s concealed knowledge an example of which is the time of the chastising of the disbelievers.
The Ant,27,76,Lo! this Qur’an narrateth unto the Children of Israel most of that concerning which they differ.,Truly this Qur’ān recounts to the Children of Israel — those living at the time of our Prophet — the means to resolve most of that concerning which they differ that is by virtue of the fact that it expounds the said differences as they should be eliminating any disagreements between them if only they were to implement it and submit to its prescriptions.
The Ant,27,77,And lo! it is a guidance and a mercy for believers.,And truly it is a guidance from error and a mercy for believers from chastisement.
The Ant,27,78,"Lo! thy Lord will judge between them of His wisdom, and He is the Mighty, the Wise.",Surely your Lord will decide between them as He will with others on the Day of Resurrection of His judgement that is His justice. And He is the Mighty the Victor the Knower of what He judges so that none will be able to oppose Him in the way that the disbelievers have opposed His prophets in this world.
The Ant,27,79,"Therefor (O Muhammad) put thy trust in Allah, for thou (standest) on the plain Truth.",So rely on God trust in Him for you are indeed upon the manifest truth upon the manifest religion the sequel shall be in your favour with victory over the disbelievers. God then draws comparisons between them and the dead the deaf and the blind saying
The Ant,27,80,"Lo! thou canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call when they have turned to flee;",Indeed you cannot make the dead hear nor can you make the deaf hear the call when al-du‘ā’a idhā read by pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second one eliding it with the yā’ they have turned their backs upon you;
The Ant,27,81,"Nor canst thou lead the blind out of their error. Thou canst make none to hear, save those who believe Our revelations and who have surrendered.",nor can you lead the blind out of their error. You can only make those hear — hear so as to comprehend and accept — who believe in Our signs — the Qur’ān — and have therefore submitted are therefore sincere in their affirmation of God’s Oneness.
The Ant,27,82,"And when the word is fulfilled concerning them, We shall bring forth a beast of the earth to speak unto them because mankind had not faith in Our revelations.",And when the word of judgement falls upon them when they deserve that chastisement befalls them as well as all other disbelievers We shall bring forth for them a beast from the earth which shall speak to them saying that is which shall speak in Arabic to those who are alive at the time when it appears among its other statements it will say to them on Our behalf ‘Indeed mankind read tukallimuhum inna’l-nāsa; a variant has tukallimuhum bi-anna’l-nāsa ‘to tell them that mankind’ had no faith in Our signs’ in other words they did not believe in the Qur’ān and what it comprises of the mention of resurrection reckoning and requital. With its the beast’s appearance the enjoining of decency and forbidding of indecency will cease and thereafter no disbeliever will believe — just as God revealed to Noah when He said to him None of your people will believe except he who has already believed Q. 1136.
The Ant,27,83,"And (remind them of) the Day when We shall gather out of every nation a host of those who denied Our revelations, and they will be set in array;",And mention the day when We shall gather from every community a group of those who denied Our signs namely their leaders the ones whom they followed and they will be set in array assembled with the last of them brought together with the first and then led away
The Ant,27,84,"Till, when they come (before their Lord), He will say: Did ye deny My revelations when ye could not compass them in knowledge, or what was it that ye did ?",until when they arrive at the site of the Reckoning He exalted be He shall say to them ‘Did you deny My prophets by denying My signs without comprehending them from the perspective of your denial in knowledge or what ammā the interrogative mā has been assimilated with am ‘or’ was it dhā is a relative pronoun in other words it is in fact mā alladhī that you did? with the commands given to you.
The Ant,27,85,"And the Word will be fulfilled concerning them because they have done wrong, and they will not speak.",And the word of judgement shall fall the chastisement will be due upon them because of the evil they committed that is because of what they associated with God and they will not speak since they will have no valid argument.
The Ant,27,86,"Have they not seen how We have appointed the night that they may rest therein, and the day sight-giving ? Lo! therein verily are portents for a people who believe.",Do they not see that We made We created the night that they like others may rest in it and the day for sight? meaning for people to see in it so that they may go about their business therein. Surely in that there are signs indications of His power exalted be He for a people who believe — they the believers are singled out for mention because they benefit from such signs in their faith in contrast to the disbelievers.
The Ant,27,87,"And (remind them of) the Day when the Trumpet will be blown, and all who are in the heavens and the earth will start in fear, save him whom Allah willeth. And all come unto Him, humbled.",And the day when the Trumpet will be blown the Horn will be blown the First Blast by the archangel Isrāfīl and whoever is in the heavens and the earth will be terrified that is a fright that brings about death — as is stated in another verse and whoever is in the heavens and whoever is in the earth will swoon Q. 3968 the past tense fazi‘a is used to express the fact that such events will have occurred; except whom God will namely Gabriel Michael Isrāfīl and the Angel of Death. According to Ibn ‘Abbās however these excepted individuals are the martyrs who are described as living with their Lord provided for by Him’ Q. 3169. And all kullun the nunation compensates for the missing genitive annexation in other words and every one of them after being brought back to life on the Day of Resurrection will come to Him read in the form of the verb atawhu or the active participle ātūhu in utter humility humbled the past tense atawhu is used to express the fact that this will have happened.
The Ant,27,88,And thou seest the hills thou deemest solid flying with the flight of clouds: the doing of Allah Who perfecteth all things. Lo! He is Informed of what ye do.,And you see the mountains you notice them at the moment of the Blast supposing them to be still stationary in their place because of their tremendous size while they drift like passing clouds like the drifting of the rain when it is blown around by the wind in other words they the mountains will be drifting in like manner until they eventually fall to the ground whereby they are flattened before becoming like tufts of ‘wool’ cf. Q. 1015 and then ‘scattered dust’ cf. Q. 566. God’s handiwork sun‘a a verbal noun emphasising the import of the preceding sentence and which has been annexed in a genitive construction to its agent Allāhi ‘God’ after the omission of its operator Who has perfected everything that He has made. Truly He is aware of what you do taf‘alūna; or read yaf‘alūna ‘what they do’ namely His enemies what they do in the way of disobedience and His friends in the way of obedience.
The Ant,27,89,Whoso bringeth a good deed will have better than its worth; and such are safe from fear that Day.,Whoever brings a good deed namely the profession of ‘there is no god but God’ on the Day of Resurrection shall have good shall have a reward for it because of it this khayrun is not the comparative ‘better’ since there is no deed better than a good deed. In another verse it is stated that he shall have tenfold the like of it Q. 6160; and they namely those who bring such good deeds shall be secure from the terror of that day min faza‘i yawmi’idhin if read as a genitive annexation; or min faza‘in yawma’idhin ‘from terror on that day’.
The Ant,27,90,"And whoso bringeth an ill-deed, such will be flung down on their faces in the Fire. Are ye rewarded aught save what ye did ?",And whoever brings an evil deed namely the ascribing of partners to God their faces shall be thrust into the Fire having been oriented towards it — ‘faces’ are specifically mentioned here because of all the sensory organs it is where a person’s dignity resides and so other parts of the body are more deserving of punishment. It shall be said to them in reproach ‘Are you requited except the requital for what you used to do?’ in the way of idolatry and acts of disobedience.
The Ant,27,91,"(Say): I (Muhammad) am commanded only to serve the Lord of this land which He hath hallowed, and unto Whom all things belong. And I am commanded to be of those who surrender (unto Him),",Say to them I have been commanded only to worship the Lord of this land namely Mecca which He has made inviolable which He has made a secure Sanctuary one in which no human blood may be shed no person may be wronged none of its prey may be hunted and a sanctuary which is never deserted. Such were the graces bestowed by God upon its inhabitants the tribe of Quraysh graces whereby God has spared their land the suffering and civil strife common to all the other lands of the Arabs; and to Whom exalted be He all things belong for He is their Lord Creator and Possessor. And I have been commanded to be of those who submit to God by affirming His Oneness;
The Ant,27,92,"And to recite the Qur’an. And whoso goeth right, goeth right only for (the good of) his own soul; and as for him who goeth astray - (Unto him) say: Lo! I am only a warner.",and to recite the Qur’ān to you as a call to faith. So whoever is guided to it is guided only for his own sake since the reward for his being guided will be his; and whoever goes astray from faith and errs from the path of guidance say to him ‘I am just one of the warners’ the threateners and therefore my duty is only to deliver the Message — this was revealed before the command to fight against the disbelievers.
The Ant,27,93,And say: Praise be to Allah Who will show you His portents so that ye shall know them. And thy Lord is not unaware of what ye (mortals) do.,And say ‘Praise be to God. He will show you His signs and you will recognise them. Thus on the day of Badr God showed them how it was to be killed to be taken prisoner and to be beaten by the angels on their faces and backs; and God hastened on for them the punishment of the Fire. And your Lord is not oblivious of what they do’ ya‘malūna; or read ta‘malūna ‘what you do’ but grants them respite until their appointed time of requital.
The Story,28,1,Ta. Sin. Mim.,Tā sīn mīm God knows best what He means by these letters.
The Story,28,2,These are revelations of the Scripture that maketh plain.,Those namely these signs are the signs of the Manifest Book the genitive annexation conveys the partitive sense of min ‘of’ ‘verses from the Manifest Book’ the Manifest Book which reveals truth from falsehood.
The Story,28,3,"We narrate unto thee (somewhat) of the story of Moses and Pharaoh with truth, for folk who believe.",We will recount narrate to you something of the tale of Moses and Pharaoh truthfully for a people who believe for their sake since they are the ones to benefit from such an account.
The Story,28,4,"Lo! Pharaoh exalted himself in the earth and made its people castes. A tribe among them he oppressed, killing their sons and sparing their women. Lo! he was of those who work corruption.",Truly Pharaoh had exalted himself in the land the land of Egypt and reduced its people into sects groups to serve him oppressing a group of them namely the Children of Israel slaughtering their sons the new-born and sparing their women keeping them alive — for some of the Egyptian priests had told him ‘A new-born of the Children of Israel shall bring about the end of your kingdom’. Indeed he was of those who cause corruption through the use of slaughter and otherwise.
The Story,28,5,"And We desired to show favour unto those who were oppressed in the earth, and to make them examples and to make them the inheritors,",And We desired to show favour to those who were oppressed in the land and to make them exemplars read a’immatan pronouncing both hamzas or by replacing the second one with a yā’ whose good example would be followed and to make them the inheritors of Pharaoh’s kingdom;
The Story,28,6,"And to establish them in the earth, and to show Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts that which they feared from them.",and to establish them in the land the land of Egypt and Syria and to show Pharaoh and Hāmān and their hosts a variant reading has wa-yarā Fir‘awnu wa-Hāmānu wa-junūduhumā ‘so that Pharaoh and Hāmān and their hosts might see’ with all three nouns in the nominative from them that of which they were apprehensive that which they feared of the new-born Israelite who would bring about the end of their kingdom.
The Story,28,7,"And We inspired the mother of Moses, saying: Suckle him and, when thou fearest for him, then cast him into the river and fear not nor grieve. Lo! We shall bring him back unto thee and shall make him (one) of Our messengers.",And We revealed by inspiration or in a dream to the mother of Moses — who was the said new-born; his sister was the only other person aware of his birth — ‘Suckle him then when you fear for him cast him into the waters namely the Nile and do not fear that he should drown or grieve for being separated from him for We will restore him to you and make him one of the messengers’. She suckled him for three months during which he never cried. She then began to fear for him and so she placed him in a basket coated with pitch and made as a cradle for him on the inside. She then closed it and cast it into the waters of the Nile at night.
The Story,28,8,"And the family of Pharaoh took him up, that he might become for them an enemy and a sorrow, Lo! Pharaoh and Haman and their hosts were ever sinning.",Then Pharaoh’s folk aids picked him up with him still in the basket the morning following that night — it was placed him in front of him Pharaoh and then opened and Moses was brought out of it sucking milk from his thumb — to be at the end of the affair an enemy slaying their menfolk and a cause of grief to them enslaving their womenfolk a variant reading for hazanan is huznan both of which are alternative forms of the verbal noun and it functions as an active participle derived from hazanahu which is like ahzanahu ‘he caused him grief’. Truly Pharaoh and his minister Hāmān and their hosts were sinners that is disobedient and so they were punished at his Moses’s hands.
The Story,28,9,"And the wife of Pharaoh said: (He will be) a consolation for me and for thee. Kill him not. Peradventure he may be of use to us, or we may choose him for a son.

Therefore he would not accept the breasts of any of the foster-mothers brought for him. So she his sister said ‘Shall I show you a household — having seen their affection for him — who will take care of him for you by having him suckled and so on and who will act in good faith towards him?’ the suffixed pronoun in lahu has been interpreted as referring to the king as a response to them when they asked Mary how she could be sure. Her suggestion was accepted. So she brought his mother and he took to her breast. She explained to them that he had taken to her breast because of her pleasant scent and the wholesome taste of her milk. Permission was given to her to breast-feed him in her own house and so she returned with him just as God exalted be He says

He Moses remained with her until he was weaned during which time she was paid wages at one dinar per day. She took this because it was money from enemy territory harbī. She then brought him back to Pharaoh in whose household he was raised as God recounts of him in sūrat al-Shu‘arā’ Q. 2618 Did we not rear you among us as a child and did you not stay with us for years of your life?
The Story,28,14,"And when he reached his full strength and was ripe, We gave him wisdom and knowledge. Thus do We reward the good.",And when he came of age namely at 30 or 33 and then was fully mature that is when he reached the age of 40 We gave him judgement wisdom and knowledge comprehension of religious matters before he was sent as a prophet.

The Story,28,15,"And he entered the city at a time of carelessness of its folk, and he found therein two men fighting, one of his own caste, and the other of his enemies; and he who was of his caste asked him for help against him who was of his enemies. So Moses struck him with his fist and killed him. He said: This is of the devil’s doing. Lo! he is an enemy, a mere misleader.",And he Moses entered the city Pharaoh’s city Memphis having been absent from it for a while at a time when its people were oblivious the time of the afternoon nap and found therein two men fighting one of his own faction namely an Israelite and the other of his enemies in other words an Egyptian who was exploiting an Israelite to carry firewood to Pharaoh’s kitchen. So the one who was of his faction called to him for help against the one who was of his enemies and so Moses said to him ‘Leave him be!’ and it is said that he replied to Moses thus ‘I am truly considering making you carry this firewood!’. So Moses punched him that is he hit him with his fist clenched — he Moses was a strong man with a powerful strike and did away with him that is he killed him but he had not intended to kill him. He buried him in the sand. He said ‘This killing of him is of Satan’s doing inciting my anger. Indeed he is an enemy to the son of Adam a manifest misleader’ of him.

He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.",He said remorsefully ‘My Lord I have indeed wronged myself by killing him so forgive me!’ So He forgave him. Truly He is the Forgiving the Merciful that is to say the One Who has always possessed and will always possess these two attributes.

Forasmuch as Thou hast favoured me, I will nevermore be a supporter of the guilty.",He said ‘My Lord forasmuch as You have been gracious to me with forgiveness protect me so I will never be a partisan a supporter of the criminals’ the disbelievers henceforth if you were to protect me.

Moses said unto him: Lo! thou art indeed a mere hothead.",In the morning he was in the city fearful vigilant waiting to see what would happen to him in reaction from the side of the slain man; — when behold the one who had sought his help the day before cried out to him for help again asking for his help against another Egyptian. Moses said to him ‘Clearly you are a trouble-maker!’ whose trouble-making is evident judging by what you did yesterday and today.
The Story,28,19,"And when he would have fallen upon the man who was an enemy unto them both, he said: O Moses! Wouldst thou kill me as thou didst kill a person yesterday. Thou wouldst be nothing but a tyrant in the land, thou wouldst not be of the reformers.",But when fa-lammā an an is extra he was about to strike the man who was an enemy to both of them to Moses and the one seeking his help he the one seeking help supposing that Moses was about to strike him because of what he Moses had said to him said ‘O Moses do you want to slay me just as you slew a soul yesterday? You merely want to be a tyrant in the land and you do not want to be of the reformers’. The Egyptian heard this and realised that the slayer had been Moses. Thus he hurried off to Pharaoh to inform him of this. Pharaoh then ordered slaughterers to slay Moses and they set off in his direction.
The Story,28,20,"And a man came from the uttermost part of the city, running. He said: O Moses! Lo! the chiefs take counsel against thee to slay thee; therefor escape. Lo! I am of those who give thee good advice.",And a man who was the only believer among Pharaoh’s kinsfolk came from the outskirts of the city hastening walking fast via a route quicker than theirs. He said ‘O Moses lo! the council of Pharaoh’s folk are conspiring discussing the means to slay you. So leave the city. Truly I am speaking to you in good faith’ in bidding you to leave.
The Story,28,21,"So he escaped from thence, fearing, vigilant. He said: My Lord! Deliver me from the wrongdoing folk.",So he departed from it fearful vigilant lest any of the pursuers catch up with him or in the hope that God might rescue him. He said ‘My Lord deliver me from the evildoing people’ Pharaoh’s people.
The Story,28,22,"And when he turned his face toward Midian, he said: Peradventure my Lord will guide me in the right road.",And when he turned his face towards Midian in the direction thereof — and this Midian was the town of the prophet Shu‘ayb eight day’s journeying from Egypt so named after Midian son of Abraham; he Moses did not know the route to it — he said ‘Perhaps my Lord will show me the right way’ that is to say which route to follow in other words the simplest route to it. God thus sent forth to him an angel with a goat which he Moses set off following towards it the town.
The Story,28,23,"And when he came unto the water of Midian he found there a whole tribe of men, watering. And he found apart from them two women keeping back (their flocks). He said: What aileth you ? The two said: We cannot give (our flocks) to drink till the shepherds return from the water; and our father is a very old man.",And when he arrived at the Water of Midian the name of a well therein he found a group of people there watering their flocks and he found besides them two women holding back their flock from the water. He Moses said to the two ‘What is your business?’ that is ‘What is the matter with you that you are not watering?’ They said ‘We do not water our flock until the shepherds have moved on ri‘ā’u ‘shepherds’ the plural of rā‘in that is to say until they have returned from the watering for fear of being crushed by the throng after which we go to water a variant reading for yasdiru ‘move on’ is the 4th form subjunctive yusdira ‘to drive away’ meaning until they the shepherds have driven their flocks away from the water’ and our father is a very old man’ unable to come and water.
The Story,28,24,"So he watered (their flock) for them. Then he turned aside into the shade, and said: My Lord! I am needy of whatever good Thou sendest down for me.",So he watered their flock for them from another well nearby by lifting a rock from on top of it which only ten men could have lifted; then he retreated to the shade of an acacia tree samura because of the extreme heat of the sun and he was hungry and said ‘My Lord indeed I am in utter need of whatever good whatever food You send down to me’. The two women returned to their father quicker than usual and so he asked them why it was so. They told him about the man who had watered their flock for them. So he said to one of them ‘Summon him to come to me’.
The Story,28,25,"Then there came unto him one of the two women, walking shyly. She said: Lo! my father biddeth thee, that he may reward thee with a payment for that thou didst water (the flock) for us. Then, when he came unto him and told him the (whole) story, he said: Fear not! Thou hast escaped from the wrongdoing folk.",God exalted be He says Then one of the two women came to him walking bashfully — in other words covering her face with the sleeve of her shirt being shy of him — and said ‘My father invites you that he may pay you a wage for watering our flock for us’. He accepted her invitation while inwardly he disapproved of accepting any wage for it was as though she sought to remunerate him and as though he were of those who would want it which he was not. She walked in front of him but when the wind began to blow off her dress and reveal her legs he said to her ‘Walk behind me and show me the way’ which she did. Finally he came to her father Shu‘ayb peace be upon him who was sitting with some supper in front of him. He said to him ‘Sit and have some supper’. He Moses said ‘I hope that this is not some sort of compensation for having watered their flock for them? For we are People of a House and do not demand compensation for good deeds’. He Shu‘ayb said ‘No. It is simply a custom of mine and of my forefathers to be hospitable to guests and to offer them food’. Thus he Moses ate and informed him of his predicament. God exalted be He says So when he came to him and recounted to him the story al-qasas is a verbal noun with the sense of al-maqsūs ‘that which is recounted’ of his slaying of the Egyptian and their intention to slay him and his fear of Pharaoh he their father said ‘Do not be afraid. You have escaped from the evildoing people’ as Pharaoh had no authority over Midian.
The Story,28,26,"One of the two women said: O my father! Hire him! For the best (man) that thou canst hire in the strong, the trustworthy.",One of the two women the one that had been sent by her father either the elder or the younger said ‘O my father hire him employ him in return for a wage that he may tend our flock instead of us. Surely the best man you can hire is the strong the trustworthy man’ in other words hire him on account of his strength and trustworthiness. He Shu‘ayb asked her about him and she told him as mentioned above how he had lifted the rock off the well and that he had said to her ‘Walk behind me’ in addition to his lowering his head when he realised that she was coming towards him refusing to lift it until she left. He Shu‘ayb therefore was keen to have him marry one of his daughters.
The Story,28,27,"He said: Lo! I fain would marry thee to one of these two daughters of mine on condition that thou hirest thyself to me for (the term of) eight pilgrimages. Then if thou completest ten it will be of thine own accord, for I would not make it hard for thee. Allah willing, thou wilt find me of the righteous.",He said ‘I desire to marry you to one of these two daughters of mine either the elder or the younger one on condition that you hire yourself to me that you are employed by me to tend my flock for eight years. And if you complete ten that is the tending of ten years that completion shall be of your own accord. I do not want to be hard on you by making it the marriage conditional on ten years service. God willing — expressed to seek God’s blessing — you shall find me to be one of the righteous’ of those who fulfil their covenants.
The Story,28,28,"He said: That (is settled) between thee and me. Whichever of the two terms I fulfil, there will be no injustice to me, and Allah is Surety over what we say.",He Moses said ‘That which you have said is settled then between me and you. Whichever of the two terms the eight or the ten the mā in ayyamā ‘whichever of the two’ is extra in other words the tending thereof I complete there shall be no injustice done to me by demanding of me to do more tending. And God is Guardian Keeper or Witness over what we you and I say’. The contract was agreed in this way. Shu‘ayb bid his daughter to give Moses a staff with which to beat off predatory beasts from his sheep — the staffs of the prophets were in his keeping. It was Adam’s staff made from the myrtle of Paradise that fell into her hands and so Moses took it with Shu‘ayb’s knowledge.
The Story,28,29,"Then, when Moses had fulfilled the term, and was travelling with his housefolk, he saw in the distance a fire and said unto his housefolk: Bide ye (here). Lo! I see in the distance a fire; peradventure I shall bring you tidings thence, or a brand from the fire that ye may warm yourselves.",So when Moses had completed the term of his tending — of eight years or of ten years which is what is generally assumed — and was travelling with his family his wife with the permission of her father in the direction of Egypt he saw in the distance on the side of the Mount Tūr a fire al-Tūr is the name of a mountain. He said to his family ‘Wait here; I see a fire in the distance. Maybe I will bring you from it news about how to rejoin the route to Egypt — for he had strayed from it along the way — or a brand read with any of the three vowels jadhwa jidhwa or judhwa which either means ‘a bundle’ or ‘a flame’ from the fire that you may warm yourselves’ tastalūna the tā’ replaces the tā’ of the 8th verbal paradigm ifta‘ala of the verb saliya or salaya.

I, even I, am Allah, the Lord of the Worlds;",And when he reached it a call came from the right bank the right side of the valley to Moses at the blessed spot blessed for Moses because of his hearing God’s speech therein from the tree mina’l-shajarati substitutes for min shāti’i ‘from the right bank’ and the preposition min ‘from’ has been repeated because it the tree grows there — the tree was a jujube a bramble or a boxthorn — saying that an here is explicative and not in its softened form ‘O Moses! Indeed I am God the Lord of the Worlds’.
The Story,28,31,"Throw down thy staff. And when he saw it writhing as it had been a demon, he turned to flee headlong, (and it was said unto him): O Moses! Draw nigh and fear not. Lo! thou art of those who are secure.",And ‘Throw down your staff’ and he threw it down. And when he saw it quivering moving as if it were a serpent jānn is a small snake so called because of the speed of its movement he turned his back to flee from it and did not look back in other words he did not return and so there called out the voice ‘O Moses! Come forward and do not be afraid. Indeed you are safe.

Have ye then no sense ?,And whatever things you have been given are only the short-lived enjoyment of the life of this world and an ornament thereof in other words things which you enjoy and adorn yourselves with for the days of your lives after which they perish; and what is with God in other words His reward is better and more lasting. Will you not understand? ta‘qilūna; or read ya‘qilūna ‘will they not understand’ that what lasts is better than what perishes.
The Story,28,61,"Is he whom We have promised a fair promise which he will find (true) like him whom We suffer to enjoy awhile the comfort of the life of the world, then on the Day of Resurrection he will be of those arraigned ?",Is he to whom We have given a fair promise which he will receive which he will attain and that promise is Paradise like him to whom We have given the enjoyment of the life of this world enjoyment which will disappear soon then on the Day of Resurrection he will be of those arraigned? before the Fire. The former is the believer the latter the disbeliever in other words the two are not equal.
The Story,28,62,On the day when He will call unto them and say: Where are My partners whom ye imagined ?,And mention the day when He God will call to them and say ‘Where then are My partners those whom you used to claim?’ were partners of Mine.
The Story,28,63,Those concerning whom the Word will have come true will say: Our Lord! These are they whom we led astray. We led them astray even as we ourselves were astray. We declare our innocence before Thee: us they never worshipped.,Those against whom the Word of punishment will have become due the justified Word that they be admitted into the Fire — and these are the leaders of misguidance — they shall say ‘Our Lord! These are the ones whom we led astray hā’ūlā’i’lladhīna aghwaynā is both a subject and an adjectival qualification. We led them astray aghwaynāhum the predicate thereof and they went astray even as we went astray — we did not compel them to follow error. We declare our innocence of them before You; it was not us that they worshipped’ mā ‘not’ is for negation; the direct object iyyānā ‘us’ precedes the verb ya‘budūna ‘they worshipped’ in order to concord with the end-rhyme of the verses.
The Story,28,64,"And it will be said: Cry unto your (so-called) partners (of Allah). And they will cry unto them, and they will give no answer unto them, and they will see the Doom. Ah, if they had but been guided!",And it shall be said ‘Call now to your associates!’ namely the idols you alleged to be partners of God.

The Story,28,65,And on the Day when He will call unto them and say: What answer gave ye to the messengers ?,And mention the day when He will call to them and say ‘What response did you give to those messengers who were sent?’ to you.
The Story,28,66,"On that day (all) tidings will be dimmed for them, nor will they ask one of another,",The tidings the news of deliverance contained in the response will be obscured to them on that day in other words they will not find any statement that might contain hope of deliverance for them; so they will not question one other about this and will fall silent.
The Story,28,67,"But as for him who shall repent and believe and do right, he haply may be one of the successful.",But as for him who repents of idolatry and believes in the affirmation of God’s Oneness and acts righteously he observes the duties of religion maybe he will be among the successful those delivered according to God’s promise.

To Him belongs all praise in the former namely the life of this world and in the latter Paradise. And to Him belongs the judgement the decree effective in the case of all things and to Him you will be returned through resurrection.
The Story,28,71,"Say: Have ye thought, if Allah made night everlasting for you till the Day of Resurrection, who is a god beside Allah who could bring you light ? Will ye not then hear ?",Say to the people of Mecca ‘Have you considered in other words inform Me if God were to make the night everlasting over you until the Day of Resurrection what god other than God as you are wont to claim could bring you light? daylight hours during which you could earn a living.

The Story,28,72,"Say: Have ye thought, if Allah made day everlasting for you till the Day of Resurrection, who is a god beside Allah who could bring you night wherein ye rest ? Will ye not then see ?",Say to them ‘Have you considered if God were to make the day everlasting over you until the Day of Resurrection what god other than God as you are wont to claim could bring you night wherein you rest? from any weariness. Will you not then see? the error you are upon when you ascribe partners to God and so repent of it.

The Story,28,74,And on the Day when He shall call unto them and say: Where are My partners whom ye pretended ?,And mention the day when He will call to them and say ‘Where now are My associates those whom you used to claim?’ — this is mentioned again in order to expound upon it

And that which they used to invent in this world of His having an associate exalted be He high above such associations will fail them.
The Story,28,76,"Now Korah was of Moses’ folk, but he oppressed them; and We gave him so much treasure that the stores thereof would verily have been a burden for a troop of mighty men. When his own folk said unto him: Exult not; lo! Allah loveth not the exultant;",Indeed Korah belonged to the people of Moses — being his paternal and maternal cousin and he had believed in him in Moses — but he became insolent towards them through his disdain haughtiness and great wealth. For We had given him so many treasures that the number of their keys would verily have burdened a group of strong men in other words they would have been too heavy for such men the bā’ of bi’l-‘usbati ‘a group’ is to render transitive the intransitive verb; the number of such men required is estimated to be 70 40 or 10; other estimates are also given. Mention when his people the believers among the Children of Israel said to him ‘Do not be exultant in your great wealth an exultation of insolence; truly God does not love the exultant in such things;
The Story,28,77,"But seek the abode of the Hereafter in that which Allah hath given thee and neglect not thy portion of the world, and be thou kind even as Allah hath been kind to thee, and seek not corruption in the earth; lo!

And do not seek to cause corruption in the earth by committing acts of disobedience. Surely God does not love the agents of corruption’ meaning that He will punish them.
The Story,28,78,He said: I have been given it only on account of knowledge I possess. Knew he not that Allah had destroyed already of the generations before him men who were mightier than him in strength and greater in respect of following ? The guilty are not questioned of their sins.,He said ‘In fact I have been given it that is this wealth because of knowledge I possess’ in other words in return for it — he was the most knowledgeable of the Children of Israel in the Torah after Moses and Aaron. God exalted be He says Does he not know that God had already destroyed before him generations communities of men stronger than him in might and greater in the amassing? of wealth; in other words he does know this. And God destroys them and the guilty will not be questioned about their sins because of God’s knowledge of these sins and so they will be admitted into the Fire without a reckoning.
The Story,28,79,"Then went he forth before his people in his pomp. Those who were desirous of the life of the world said: Ah, would that we had the like of what hath been given unto Korah! Lo! he is lord of rare good fortune.",So he Korah emerged before his people in his finery with his large retinue all of them in procession dressed in gold and silk garments and mounted on adorned horses and mules. Those who desired the life of this world said ‘O yā is for drawing attention would that we had the like of what Korah has been given this world. Truly he enjoys great fortune’ abundant fortune in it.

The reward of Allah for him who believeth and doeth right is better, and only the steadfast will obtain it.",But those to whom knowledge had been given knowledge of what God had promised in the Hereafter said to them ‘Woe to you! waylakum is an expression of reprimand God’s reward of Paradise in the Hereafter is better for him who believes and acts righteously than what Korah has been given in this world; and none will obtain it namely the Paradise that is given as a reward except those who are steadfast’ in their adherence to obedience and refrain from disobedience.

Then he had no host to help him against Allah, nor was he of those who can save themselves.",So We caused the earth to swallow him Korah and his dwelling and he had no host to help him besides God that is other than Him to protect him from destruction nor was he of those who can rescue themselves from it.
The Story,28,82,"And morning found those who had coveted his place but yesterday crying: Ah, welladay! Allah enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His slaves and straiteneth it (for whom He will). If Allah had not been gracious unto us He would have caused it to swallow us (also). Ah, welladay! the disbelievers never prosper.",And those who had longed to be in his place the day before that is only recently were saying ‘Alas! God expands provision for whomever He will of His servants and straitens it He restricts it for whomever He will way-ka’anna way is a noun of action with the sense of ‘How astonished I am’ while the kāf functions as a causative lām ‘because’. Had God not been gracious to us He would have made us to be swallowed too’ read active la-khasafa or passive la-khusifa. Lo! indeed those who are ungrateful for God’s grace such as Korah never prosper.

The sequel is for those who ward off (evil).",That is the Abode of the Hereafter namely Paradise which We shall grant to those who do not desire to be haughty in the earth through insolence nor to cause corruption by committing acts of disobedience.

The Story,28,85,Lo! He Who hath given thee the Qur’an for a law will surely bring thee home again. Say: My Lord is Best Aware of him who bringeth guidance and him who is in error manifest.,Indeed He Who has prescribed for you the Qur’ān He Who has revealed it will surely restore you to a place of return to Mecca — he had yearned for it. Say ‘My Lord knows best him who brings guidance and him who is in manifest error’ — this was revealed in order to refute what the Meccan disbelievers had said to him ‘Indeed you are error’. In other words God is saying that he the Prophet is the one who has brought guidance while they are the ones in error.
The Story,28,86,"Thou hadst no hope that the Scripture would be inspired in thee; but it is a mercy from thy Lord, so never be a helper to the disbelievers.",And you never expected that the Scripture the Qur’ān would be conferred on you; but it was conferred on you as a mercy from your Lord.

The Story,28,88,"And cry not unto any other god along with Allah. There is no God save Him. Everything will perish save His countenance. His is the command, and unto Him ye will be brought back.",And do not call on do not worship another god with God; there is no god except Him.

The Spider,29,1,Alif. Lam. Mim.,Alif lām mīm God knows best what He means by these letters.
The Spider,29,2,"Do men imagine that they will be left (at ease) because they say, We believe, and will not be tested with affliction ?",Do people suppose that they will be left to say that is that they will be left alone because of their saying ‘We believe’ and they will not be tried? tested with that which will reveal the sincerity of their belief. This verse was revealed regarding a group of individuals who when they became believers endured suffering at the hands of the idolaters.
The Spider,29,3,"Lo! We tested those who were before you. Thus Allah knoweth those who are sincere, and knoweth those who feign.",And certainly We tried those who were before them. So God shall surely know those who are sincere in their faith — a knowledge of direct vision — and He shall surely know those who are liars regarding it.
The Spider,29,4,Or do those who do ill-deeds imagine that they can outstrip Us ? Evil (for them) is that which they decide.,Or do those who commit evil deeds idolatry and acts of disobedience suppose that they can elude Us? so that We will not be able to requite them. Evil is that judgement of theirs which they judge!

And He is the Hearer of the sayings of His servants the Knower of their actions.
The Spider,29,6,"And whosoever striveth, striveth only for himself, for lo! Allah is altogether Independent of (His) creatures.",And whoever struggles in war or against the temptations of his own soul struggles only for his own sake because the benefits to be reaped from his struggle will be for his sake and not for God’s. For truly God is Independent of the creatures of all the Worlds mankind jinn and angels and He is also without need of their worship.
The Spider,29,7,"And as for those who believe and do good works, We shall remit from them their evil deeds and shall repay them the best that they did.",And those who believe and perform righteous deeds We will surely absolve them of their misdeeds by their performance of righteous deeds and We will indeed requite them with the best of what they used to do namely their righteous deeds it ahsana is in the accusative because the operator of the oblique bi has been omitted.
The Spider,29,8,"We have enjoined on man kindness to parents; but if they strive to make thee join with Me that of which thou hast no knowledge, then obey them not. Unto Me is your return and I shall tell you what ye used to do.",And We have enjoined on man kindness to his parents that he should be dutiful towards them; but if they urge you to ascribe to Me as partner that of which you do not have any knowledge any knowledge that accords with reality and so is meaningless then do not obey them in such incitements to idolatry. To Me will be your return whereat I will inform you of what you used to do and I will requite you for it.
The Spider,29,9,"And as for those who believe and do good works, We verily shall make them enter in among the righteous.",And those who believe and perform righteous deeds assuredly We shall admit them among the righteous among the prophets and the saints by gathering in the company of one another at the Resurrection.
The Spider,29,10,"Of mankind is he who saith: We believe in Allah, but, if he be made to suffer for the sake of Allah, he mistaketh the persecution of mankind for Allah’s punishment; and then, if victory cometh from thy Lord, will say: Lo! we were with you (all the while). Is not Allah Best Aware of what is in the bosoms of (His) creatures ?",And among people there are those who say ‘We believe in God’ but if such a person suffers hurt in God’s cause he takes people’s persecution that is their harming of him to be the same as God’s chastisement in terms of his fear of it and so he obeys them and behaves hypocritically. Yet if la-in the lām is for oaths there comes help to believers from your Lord and they take spoils they will assuredly say la-yaqūlunna the final nūn of the indicative has been omitted because of the other nūn coming after it and likewise the wāw indicating the plural person has been replaced by a damma because of two unvocalised consonants coming together ‘We were indeed with you’ in faith so give us a share of the booty. God exalted be He says Does God not know best what is in the breasts of all creatures? what is in their hearts of faith or hypocrisy? Indeed He does.
The Spider,29,11,"Verily Allah knoweth those who believe, and verily He knoweth the hypocrites.",And God shall surely ascertain those who believe in their hearts and He shall surely ascertain the hypocrites and He will requite each group accordingly the lām in both verbs la-ya‘lamanna ‘He shall ascertain’ is for oaths.
The Spider,29,12,Those who disbelieve say unto those who believe: Follow our way (of religion) and we verily will bear your sins (for you). They cannot bear aught of their sins. Lo! they verily are liars.,And those who disbelieve say to those who believe ‘Follow our path our religion and we will bear responsibility for your sins’ when you follow us should there be any such sins the imperative here functions as a predicate. God exalted be He says But they will not be able to bear anything of their sins. Truly they are liars in saying this.
The Spider,29,13,"But they verily will bear their own loads and other loads beside their own, and they verily will be questioned on the Day of Resurrection concerning that which they invented.",And they shall certainly bear their own burdens their sins and other burdens along with their own burdens as punishment for saying to believers Follow our path previous verse and for their leading astray those who follow them blindly; and on the Day of Resurrection they shall surely be questioned concerning what they used to invent what they used to fabricate of lies against God a questioning of rebuke the lām in both verbs la-yahmilunna and la-yus’alunna is for oaths; in both verbs the plural indicators of the subject wāw and nūn -ūna have been omitted.
The Spider,29,14,"And verily we sent Noah (as Our messenger) unto his folk, and he continued with them for a thousand years save fifty years; and the flood engulfed them, for they were wrong-doers.",And verily We sent Noah to his people when he was forty years of age or older and he remained among them a thousand-less-fifty years calling them to affirm God’s Oneness but they denied him; so the Flood engulfed them a deluge of water drifted against them rising above them and drowning them for they were wrongdoers idolaters.
The Spider,29,15,"And We rescued him and those with him in the ship, and made of it a portent for the peoples.",Then We delivered him namely Noah and the occupants of the ship those who were with him in it and We made this a sign a lesson for all peoples for all peoples that would come after them should they disobey the messengers sent to them. Noah lived for a further sixty years or more after the Flood until mankind multiplied again.
The Spider,29,16,"And Abraham! (Remember) when he said unto his folk: Serve Allah, and keep your duty unto Him; that is better for you if ye did but know.",And mention Abraham when he said to his people ‘Worship God and fear Him fear His punishment; that is better for you than the worship of idols which you practice if you only knew what is good from what is otherwise.
The Spider,29,17,"Ye serve instead of Allah only idols, and ye only invent a lie. Lo! those whom ye serve instead of Allah own no provision for you. So seek your provision from Allah, and serve Him, and give thanks unto Him, (for) unto Him ye will be brought back.",What you worship besides God that is other than Him are only graven images and you fabricate a calumny you speak lies such as ‘These graven images are God’s partners’. Truly those whom you worship besides God have no power to provide for you. So seek your provision from God request it from Him and worship Him and be thankful to Him; to Him you shall be returned.
The Spider,29,18,"But if ye deny, then nations have denied before you. The messenger is only to convey (the message) plainly.",But if you deny that is if you deny me O people of Mecca then many communities have denied before you that is before my time; and the messenger’s duty is only to communicate the Message clearly’. Both stories are meant to comfort the Prophet s. And regarding his people God exalted be He says
The Spider,29,19,"See they not how Allah produceth creation, then reproduceth it ? Lo! for Allah that is easy.",Have they not seen yaraw or taraw ‘have you not seen?’ observed how God originates creation yubdi’u from 4th form abda’a; a variant reading has yabda‘u from 1st form bada’a both with the same meaning ‘He creates them originally’ then He restores it namely creation just as He originated them? Surely that which is mentioned of the first and the second acts of creation is easy for God so how can they deny the second one?
The Spider,29,20,"Say (O Muhammad): Travel in the land and see how He originated creation, then Allah bringeth forth the later growth. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.",Say ‘Travel in the land and observe how He originated creation of those before you and how He made them die. Then God shall bring about the other genesis al-nashā’a or al-nash’a. Truly God has power over all things among them the origination of creation and the restoration thereof.
The Spider,29,21,"He punisheth whom He will and showeth mercy unto whom He will, and unto Him ye will be turned.",He chastises whomever He will to chastise and has mercy on whomever He will to have mercy and to Him you shall be returned.
The Spider,29,22,"Ye cannot escape (from Him) in the earth or in the sky, and beside Allah there is for you no friend or helper.",And you will never be able to thwart Him your Lord and prevent Him from catching up with you on earth or in the heaven were you to be in it in other words you cannot elude Him; and you do not have besides God that is other than Him any guardian to defend you against Him or any helper to help you escape from His chastisement.
The Spider,29,23,"Those who disbelieve in the revelations of Allah and in (their) Meeting with Him, such have no hope of My mercy. For such there is a painful doom.",And those who disbelieve in God’s signs and the encounter with Him namely the Qur’ān and the Resurrection respectively they have despaired of My mercy that is of attaining My Paradise and for those there shall be a painful chastisement.
The Spider,29,24,"But the answer of his folk was only that they said: ""Kill him"" or ""Burn him."" Then Allah saved him from the Fire. Lo! herein verily are portents for folk who believe.",God exalted be He says with regard to the tale of Abraham peace be upon him But the only answer of his people was that they said ‘Slay him or burn him!’ Then God delivered him from the fire into which they threw him by making it cool and harmless for him. Surely in that namely in that deliverance of him from it there are signs — namely the fact that it did not have any affect on him despite its greatness and the fact that it was extinguished and that within a brief period meadows sprung up in its place — for a people who believe a people who affirm the truth of God’s Oneness and His power for they are the ones to benefit from these signs.
The Spider,29,25,"He said: Ye have chosen only idols instead of Allah. The love between you is only in the life of the world. Then on the Day of Resurrection ye will deny each other and curse each other, and your abode will be the Fire, and ye will have no helpers.",And he Abraham said ‘You have adopted mere idols besides God which you worship mā of innamā relates to the verbal noun for the sake of mutual affection between you mawaddatu baynikum this is the predicate of inna of innamā; the accusative reading mawaddata baynikum would denote a direct object denoting reason so that the mā would denote ‘entirety’ — in other words you are friends of one another in your worship of them in the life of this world. Then on the Day of Resurrection you will disown one another the leaders will dissociate from those who followed them; and you will curse one another those who followed will curse their leaders; and your abode your destination all together will be the Fire and you will have no helpers’ to protect you against it.
The Spider,29,26,"And Lot believed him, and said: Lo! I am a fugitive unto my Lord. Lo! He, only He, is the Mighty, the Wise.",And Lot believed in him he affirmed the sincerity of Abraham and he was his paternal nephew from his brother Hārān and he Abraham said ‘Indeed I am migrating away from my people toward my Lord to where my Lord commands. So he shunned his people and emigrated from the rural lands of Iraq to Syria. Indeed He is the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise’ in what He does.
The Spider,29,27,"And We bestowed on him Isaac and Jacob, and We established the prophethood and the Scripture among his seed, and We gave him his reward in the world, and lo! in the Hereafter he verily is among the righteous.",And We gave him after Ishmael Isaac and Jacob after Isaac; and We ordained among his descendants prophethood thus all prophets after Abraham are descended from him and the Scripture meaning the Holy Books the Torah the Gospels the Psalms and the Criterion al-furqān. And We gave him his reward in this world which is fair praise of him by members of all the Abrahamic religions. And in the Hereafter he shall truly be among the righteous for whom there shall be the highest degrees of reward.
The Spider,29,28,And Lot! (Remember) when he said unto his folk: Lo! ye commit lewdness such as no creature did before you.,And mention Lot when he said to his people ‘Truly you read a-innakum pronouncing both hamzas or not pronouncing the second and inserting an alif between the two in either case and in both instances commit lewdness namely coming in unto the rears of men such as none in all the worlds of jinn or men has committed before you.
The Spider,29,29,"For come ye not in unto males, and cut ye not the road (for travellers), and commit ye not abomination in your meetings ? But the answer of his folk was only that they said: Bring Allah’s doom upon us if thou art a truthteller!",What! Do you come unto men and cut off the way the travel roads of passers-by committing lewd acts with whoever passes your way such that people ceased to pass by where you live and you discuss in your gatherings in your conversations indecency?’ you discuss committing lewd acts with one another. But the only answer of his people was that they said ‘Bring us the chastisement of God if you are truthful’ in your deeming such acts vile and that chastisement will befall those who do such things.
The Spider,29,30,He said: My Lord! Give me victory over folk who work corruption.,He said ‘My Lord help me by making that of which I spoke come true regarding the sending down of chastisement against the people who work corruption’ those who are disobedient by coming unto men. So God answered his call.

We are to deliver him and his household, all save his wife, who is of those who stay behind.",He Abraham said ‘Lo! Lot is in it.’ They namely the messengers said ‘We know very well who is in it. Assuredly We shall deliver him read la-nunjiyannahu or la-nunajjiyannahu and his family except his wife she is of those who will stay behind’ of those who will remain behind in the chastisement.
The Spider,29,33,"And when Our messengers came unto Lot, he was troubled upon their account, for he could not protect them; but they said: Fear not, nor grieve! Lo! we are to deliver thee and thy household, (all) save thy wife, who is of those who stay behind.",And when Our messengers came to Lot he was distressed on their account he was grieved because of them and he was constrained unable to help them because they had handsome faces dressed as guests and thus he feared for them from his people. So they informed him that they were the messengers of his Lord. But they said ‘Do not be afraid nor grieve. We shall surely deliver you read munajjūka or munjūka and your family except your wife she is of those who will remain behind ahlaka ‘your family’ is in the accusative as a supplement to the suffixed direct object pronoun kāf of munajjūka ‘We shall surely deliver you’.
The Spider,29,34,Lo! We are about to bring down upon the folk of this township a fury from the sky because they are evil-livers.,We are indeed going to bring down read munzilūna or munazzilūna upon the people of this town a scourge a chastisement from the heaven because of on account of the acts of their immorality’.

Serve Allah, and look forward to the Last Day, and do not evil, making mischief, in the earth.",And We sent to Midian their brother Shu‘ayb. He said ‘O my people! Worship God and anticipate the Last Day fear it namely the Day of Resurrection; and do not be degenerate in the earth working corruption’ mufsidīna is a circumstantial qualifier emphasising its operator wa-lā ta‘thaw ‘do not be degenerate’; it the verb derives from ‘athiya meaning afsada ‘he corrupted’.
The Spider,29,37,"But they denied him, and the dreadful earthquake took them, and morning found them prostrate in their dwelling place.",But they denied him and so the earthquake the violent tremor seized them and they ended up lying lifeless prostrate in their habitations keeled over their knees dead.
The Spider,29,38,"And (the tribes of) A’ad and Thamud! (Their fate) is manifest unto you from their (ruined and deserted) dwellings. Satan made their deeds seem fair unto them and so debarred them from the Way, though they were keen observers.",And We destroyed ‘Ād and Thamūd may be fully declined or not as diptotes denoting both the district or the tribe respectively— it is indeed evident to you their destruction from their former dwellings in al-Hijr and in Yemen. For Satan adorned for them their deeds of disbelief and disobedience and thus barred them from the Way the way of truth though they had been discerning perceptive people.
The Spider,29,39,"And Korah, Pharaoh and Haman! Moses came unto them with clear proofs (of Allah’s Sovereignty), but they were boastful in the land. And they were not winners (in the race).",And We destroyed Korah and Pharaoh and Hāmān! And verily Moses brought them beforehand clear signs manifest proofs but they acted arrogantly in the land; and they could not thwart Us they could not elude Our chastisement.
The Spider,29,40,"So We took each one in his sin; of them was he on whom We sent a hurricane, and of them was he who was overtaken by the (Awful) Cry, and of them was he whom We caused the earth to swallow, and of them was he whom We drowned. It was not for Allah to wrong them, but they wronged themselves.",So each of those mentioned We seized for his sin; and among them were some upon whom We unleashed a squall of stones as in the case of the people of Lot and among them were some who were seized by the Cry such as Thamūd and among them were some whom We made the earth swallow such as Korah and among them were some whom We drowned like the people of Noah Pharaoh and his people. And God never wronged them by chastising them for having committed no sin but they wronged themselves by committing sins.
The Spider,29,41,"The likeness of those who choose other patrons than Allah is as the likeness of the spider when she taketh unto herself a house, and lo! the frailest of all houses is the spider’s house, if they but knew.",The likeness of those who choose besides God other patrons namely idols from whom they hope to profit is as the likeness of the spider that makes a home for itself in which to shelter. And truly the frailest the weakest of homes is the home of the spider for it neither protects it from heat nor cold — likewise idols cannot benefit those who worship them — if they only knew this they would not worship them.
The Spider,29,42,"Lo! Allah knoweth what thing they invoke instead of Him. He is the Mighty, the Wise.",Truly God knows whatever thing mā functions like alladhī they call on what they worship read yad‘ūna ‘they call on’ or tad‘ūna ‘you call on’ besides Him other than Him. And He is the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise in what He does.
The Spider,29,43,"As for these similitudes, We coin them for mankind, but none will grasp their meaning save the wise.",And such similitudes in the Qur’ān We strike them We coin them for the sake of mankind; but none understands them none grasp them except those who know those who reflect.
The Spider,29,44,Allah created the heavens and the earth with truth. Lo! therein is indeed a portent for believers.,God created the heavens and the earth with truth that is rightly. Surely in that there is a sign indicating His power exalted be He for believers — they are specifically mentioned because they are the ones to benefit thereby in their faith in contrast to disbelievers.
The Spider,29,45,"Recite that which hath been inspired in thee of the Scripture, and establish worship. Lo! worship preserveth from lewdness and iniquity, but verily remembrance of Allah is more important. And Allah knoweth what ye do.",Recite what has been revealed to you of the Book the Qur’ān and maintain prayer; truly prayer prohibits lewd acts and indecency defined as such according to the Law. In other words that is its purpose provided that the person adheres to observance of it. And the remembrance of God is surely greater than other acts of obedience and God knows what you do and He will requite you for them.
The Spider,29,46,"And argue not with the People of the Scripture unless it be in (a way) that is better, save with such of them as do wrong; and say: We believe in that which hath been revealed unto us and revealed unto you; our God and your God is One, and unto Him we surrender.",And do not dispute with the People of the Scripture unless it be with that — in that manner of disputation bettering the most virtuous way such as calling them to God by reference to His signs and pointing out His arguments; except in the case of those of them who have done wrong by waging war and refusing to accept to pay the jizya-tax dispute with these using the sword until such time as they submit or pay the jizya-tax; and say to those who have accepted the imposition upon them of the jizya-tax should they inform you of something stated in their Scriptures ‘We believe in that which has been revealed to us and revealed to you — and neither believe nor disbelieve them in that which they tell you — our God and your God is one and the same and to Him we submit’ to Him we are obedient.
The Spider,29,47,"In like manner We have revealed unto thee the Scripture, and those unto whom We gave the Scripture aforetime will believe therein; and of these (also) there are some who believe therein. And none deny Our revelations save the disbelievers.",Thus have We revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān in the same way that We have revealed to them the Torah and other scripture. And so those to whom We have given the Scripture the Torah such as ‘Abd Allāh b. Salām and others believe in it in the Qur’ān and of these people of Mecca there are some who believe in it; and none denies Our signs after they have been manifested except disbelievers namely the Jews and those for whom it was apparent that the Qur’ān was the truth and that the one who brought it was truthful but still denied it.
The Spider,29,48,"And thou (O Muhammad) wast not a reader of any scripture before it, nor didst thou write it with thy right hand, for then might those have doubted, who follow falsehood.",And you did not use to recite before this namely before the Qur’ān any other Book nor did you write it with your right hand for had you been reciting something and writing then those who follow falsehood the Jews would have had doubts about you and would have said ‘What the Torah states is that he will be unlettered ummī unable to read or write’.
The Spider,29,49,"But it is clear revelations in the hearts of those who have been given knowledge, and none deny Our revelations save wrong-doers.",Nay but it that is the Qur’ān which you have brought is clear signs in the breasts of those who have been given knowledge namely the believers who preserve it in their hearts and none denies Our signs except wrongdoers namely the Jews — they denied them after they were manifested to them.
The Spider,29,50,"And they say: Why are not portents sent down upon him from his Lord ? Say: Portents are with Allah only, and I am but a plain warner.",And they namely the disbelievers of Mecca say ‘Why has not some sign been sent down to him to Muhammad (s) from his Lord?’ āyatun ‘sign’ a variant reading has āyātun ‘signs’ such as the she-camel of Sālih or the staff of Moses or the Table of Jesus. Say to them ‘Signs are only with God and He sends them down as He will and I am only a plain warner’ making manifest my warning of the punishment of the Fire for disobedient people.
The Spider,29,51,"Is it not enough for them that We have sent down unto thee the Scripture which is read unto them ? Lo! herein verily is mercy, and a reminder for folk who believe.",Is it not sufficient for them regarding what they have demanded that We have revealed to you the Book the Qur’ān which is recited to them? — as it constitutes a ongoing sign that will never terminate in contrast to the signs mentioned. Surely in that Book is mercy and a reminder an admonition for a people who believe.
The Spider,29,52,"Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Allah sufficeth for witness between me and you. He knoweth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. And those who believe in vanity and disbelieve in Allah, they it is who are the losers.",Say ‘God suffices as a witness between me and you’ of my sincerity. He knows whatever is in the heavens and the earth including my circumstances and yours. And those who believe in falsehood namely all that is worshipped besides God and who disbelieve in God from among you — those they are the losers in their bargain for they have purchased disbelief in return for faith.
The Spider,29,53,"They bid thee hasten on the doom (of Allah). And if a term had not been appointed, the doom would assuredly have come unto them (ere now). And verily it will come upon them suddenly when they perceive not.",And they ask you to hasten the chastisement. Yet were it not for an appointed term for this chastisement the chastisement would have come upon them before long but it shall assuredly come upon them suddenly while they are unaware of the time of its coming.
The Spider,29,54,"They bid thee hasten on the doom, when lo! hell verily will encompass the disbelievers",And they ask you to hasten the chastisement in this world. And lo! Hell shall encompass the disbelievers
The Spider,29,55,"On the day when the doom will overwhelm them from above them and from underneath their feet, and He will say: Taste what ye used to do!",on the Day when the chastisement shall envelop them from above them and from under their feet and We shall say thereat read the verb as naqūlu in other words ‘We shall command that it be said; or if read yaqūlu ‘he shall say’ namely the one in charge of meting out chastisement ‘Taste now what you used to do!’ that is taste the requital for it as you will not be able to elude Us.
The Spider,29,56,O my bondmen who believe! Lo! My earth is spacious. Therefor serve Me only.,O My servants who believe! My earth is indeed vast. So worship only Me in whichever land worship is possible by emigrating to it from a land in which worship is not possible — this verse was revealed regarding the oppressed Muslims living in Mecca who were constrained to manifest their Islam in it.
The Spider,29,57,Every soul will taste of death. Then unto Us ye will be returned.,Every soul shall taste death. Then to Us you shall be returned turja‘ūna; or yurja‘ūna ‘they shall be returned’ after resurrection.
The Spider,29,58,"Those who believe and do good works, them verily We shall house in lofty dwellings of the Garden underneath which rivers flow. There they will dwell secure. How sweet the guerdon of the toilers,",And those who believe and perform righteous deeds We shall surely lodge them We shall give them residence a variant reading has nuthwiyannahum derived from thawā’ ‘residence’; the transitive link to the indirect object ghurafan is made without the preposition fī ‘in’ in lofty abodes of Paradise underneath which rivers flow to abide decreed for them to live forever in them — excellent is this reward as the reward of the toilers;
The Spider,29,59,"Who persevere, and put their trust in their Lord!",they are those who are steadfast in enduring the harm inflicted upon them by the idolaters and in enduring the Emigration in order to make manifest the religion of Islam and who put their trust in their Lord so that He provides for them whence they do not expect.
The Spider,29,60,"And how many an animal there is that beareth not its own provision! Allah provideth for it and for you. He is the Hearer, the Knower.",And how many ka-ayyin means kam an animal there is that does not bear its own provision on account of its inability to do so. Yet God provides for it and for you O Emigrants al-muhājirūn even when you carry with you neither supplies nor substance. And He is the Hearer of your sayings the Knower of your consciences.
The Spider,29,61,"And if thou wert to ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth, and constrained the sun and the moon (to their appointed work) ? they would say: Allah. How then are they turned away ?",And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you were to ask them namely the disbelievers ‘Who created the heavens and the earth and disposed the sun and the moon?’ They would assuredly say ‘God.’ So how then are they turned away? from affirming His Oneness after affirming that God created them.
The Spider,29,62,"Allah maketh the provision wide for whom He will of His bondmen, and straiteneth it for whom (He will). Lo! Allah is Aware of all things.",God extends provision He makes it abundant for whomever He will of His servants by way of a test and He straitens He restricts it for him after having extended it that is for whomever He will to try. Truly God has knowledge of all things among them the occasion in which it is appropriate for Him to extend or to straiten.
The Spider,29,63,"And if thou wert to ask them: Who causeth water to come down from the sky, and therewith reviveth the earth after its death ? they verily would say: Allah. Say: Praise be to Allah! But most of them have no sense.",And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you were to ask them ‘Who sends down water from the heaven and therewith revives the earth after its death?’ They would assuredly say ‘God’ so how can they ascribe partners to Him?! Say to them ‘Praise be to God!’ that the proof has been established against you. Nay but most of them do not realise their contradictiousness in this respect.
The Spider,29,64,"This life of the world is but a pastime and a game. Lo! the home of the Hereafter - that is Life, if they but knew.",And the life of this world is nothing but diversion and play whereas closeness to God pertains to concern for the Hereafter since the fruits thereof will be revealed in it. But surely the Abode of the Hereafter is indeed the true Life if they only knew this then they would not prefer this world to it.
The Spider,29,65,"And when they mount upon the ships they pray to Allah, making their faith pure for Him only, but when He bringeth them safe to land, behold! they ascribe partners (unto Him),",And when they board the ship they call on God making their supplications purely to Him in other words they do not call on any other besides Him suffering distress which only He is able to remove; but when He delivers them to land behold! they ascribe partners to Him
The Spider,29,66,"That they may disbelieve in that which We have given them, and that they may take their ease. But they will come to know.",that they may be ungrateful for what We have bestowed on them of graces and that they may seek enjoyment in consenting to worship idols together a variant reading for the purposive wa-li-yatamatta‘ū has wa’l-yatamatta‘ū ‘and let them seek their enjoyment’ as an imperative denoting a threat for they will soon know! the consequences of this.
The Spider,29,67,"Have they not seen that We have appointed a sanctuary immune (from violence), while mankind are ravaged all around them ? Do they then believe in falsehood and disbelieve in the bounty of Allah ?",Or is it that they have not seen have not realised that We have appointed their town of Mecca to be a secure Sanctuary while people are snatched away all around them? by being killed or taken captive except for them? Is it that they believe in falsehood in the idol and are wont to be ungrateful for God’s grace? when they ascribe partners to Him?
The Spider,29,68,"Who doeth greater wrong than he who inventeth a lie concerning Allah, or denieth the truth when it cometh unto him ? Is not there a home in hell for disbelievers ?",And who — in other words there is none who — does greater wrong than he who invents a lie against God by ascribing partners to Him or denies truth be it the Prophet or the Book when it comes to him? Is there not in Hell a lodging an abode for the disbelievers? in other words there is such an abode therein and such a person belongs with them.
The Spider,29,69,"As for those who strive in Us, We surely guide them to Our paths, and lo! Allah is with the good.",But as for those who struggle for Our sake for Our truth We shall assuredly guide them in Our ways that is the means to come to Us and truly God is with the virtuous the believers assisting and helping.
The Romans,30,1,Alif. Lam. Mim.,Alif lām mīm God knows best what He means by these letters.
The Romans,30,2,The Romans have been defeated,The Byzantines — who are among the People of the Scripture — have been vanquished; the Persians vanquished them and they are not people of a scripture but worship graven images. The Meccan disbelievers rejoiced in this defeat of the Byzantines and said to the Muslims ‘We shall vanquish you as the Persians vanquished the Byzantines’;
The Romans,30,3,"In the nearer land, and they, after their defeat will be victorious",in the nearer part of the land that is in the Byzantine land that lies nearest to Persia in Mesopotamia al-Jazīra. There the two armies met and the Persians were the ones who had begun the invasion. But they that is the Byzantines after their vanquishing ghalabihim the verbal noun ghalab has been annexed to the direct object hum in other words ghalabatu fāris iyyāhum ‘the Persians’ vanquishing of them’ shall be the victors over the Persians
The Romans,30,4,Within ten years - Allah’s is the command in the former case and in the latter - and in that day believers will rejoice,in a few years bid‘ usually means between three and nine or ten years. So the two armies met again seven years after this former encounter and the Byzantines defeated the Persians. To God belongs the command before and after that is before the defeat of the Byzantines and thereafter that is to say the Persian victory at first and the Byzantine victory later were the result of God’s command in other words His will and on that day the day when the Byzantines will be victorious the believers shall rejoice
The Romans,30,5,"In Allah’s help to victory. He helpeth to victory whom He will. He is the Mighty, the Merciful.",in God’s help to them against the Persians. They the believers indeed rejoiced in this as they came to know of it on the day that it took place on the day of the battle of Badr when Gabriel came down with this news thereon in addition to their rejoicing in their victory over the idolaters on that same day. He helps whomever He will; and He is the Mighty the Victor the Merciful to believers.
The Romans,30,6,"It is a promise of Allah. Allah faileth not His promise, but most of mankind know not.",The promise of God wa‘da’Llāhi is the verbal noun substituting for the full verbal construction; it is actually wa‘adahumu’Llāhu al-nasr ‘God promised them victory’. God does not fail His promise of such help but most people namely the disbelievers of Mecca are not aware of His promise to help them to victory.
The Romans,30,7,"They know only some appearance of the life of the world, and are heedless of the Hereafter.",They know merely an outward aspect of the life of this world that is to say its various means of securing livelihood such as commerce agriculture construction and cultivation and so on; but they of the Hereafter they are oblivious this repetition of hum ‘they’ is for emphasis.
The Romans,30,8,"Have they not pondered upon themselves ? Allah created not the heavens and the earth, and that which is between them, save with truth and for a destined end. But truly many of mankind are disbelievers in the meeting with their Lord.",Have they not contemplated themselves? so that they might emerge from their oblivion. God did not create the heavens and the earth and what is between them except with the truth and an appointed term for that creation at the conclusion of which this creation will perish and after which will be the Resurrection. But indeed many people that is to say such as the Meccan disbelievers disbelieve in the encounter with their Lord that is they do not believe in resurrection after death.
The Romans,30,9,"Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them ? They were stronger than these in power, and they dug the earth and built upon it more than these have built. Messengers of their own came unto them with clear proofs (of Allah’s Sovereignty). Surely Allah wronged them not, but they did wrong themselves.",Have they not travelled in the land and beheld how was the consequence for those before them? of past communities which was that they were destroyed for denying their messengers. They were more powerful than them — such were ‘Ād and Thamūd — and they effected the land they tilled it and churned it up to sow crops and cultivate trees and developed it more than these the Meccan disbelievers have developed it; and their messengers brought them clear signs manifest proofs for God would never wrong them by destroying them without being guilty but they used to wrong themselves by denying their messengers.
The Romans,30,10,"Then evil was the consequence to those who dealt in evil, because they denied the revelations of Allah and made a mock of them.",Then the consequence for those who committed evil was evil al-sū’ā is the feminine form of al-aswa’ ‘the worst’; it may be read as the predicate of kāna if one reads ‘āqibatu in the nominative; or it is the subject of kāna if read as ‘āqibata in the accusative; and so what is meant is Hell in the former reading or according to the latter reading simply their evil actions because they denied the signs of God the Qur’ān and made a mock of them.
The Romans,30,11,"Allah produceth creation, then He reproduceth it, then unto Him ye will be returned.",God originates creation in other words He produces the creation of mankind then He will reproduce it that is the creation of them after their death then to Him you shall be returned read turja‘ūna; or yurja‘ūna ‘they shall be returned’.
The Romans,30,12,And in the day when the Hour riseth the unrighteous will despair.,And on the Day when the Hour comes the sinners will be dumbfounded the idolaters will be fall into silence as their line of argument can no longer be continued.
The Romans,30,13,There will be none to intercede for them of those whom they made equal with Allah. And they will reject their partners (whom they ascribed unto Him).,And none from among those partners of theirs those whom they ascribed as partners of God namely the idols to intercede for them shall be intercessors for them and they shall disavow these partners of theirs in other words they shall dissociate from them.
The Romans,30,14,"In the day when the Hour cometh, in that day they will be sundered.",And on the Day when the Hour comes that day yawma’idhin is repeated for emphasis they believers and disbelievers shall be separated.
The Romans,30,15,"As for those who believed and did good works, they will be made happy in a Garden.",As for those who believed and performed righteous deeds they shall be made happy in a garden of Paradise.
The Romans,30,16,"But as for those who disbelieved and denied Our revelations, and denied the meeting of the Hereafter, such will be brought to doom.",But as for those who disbelieved and denied Our signs namely the Qur’ān and the encounter of the Hereafter the Resurrection and other matters those they shall be arraigned into the chastisement.
The Romans,30,17,So glory be to Allah when ye enter the night and when ye enter the morning -,So glory be to God — in other words so glorify God meaning perform prayer — when you enter the time of the night in which there are two prayers the sunset one maghrib and the later night one ‘ishā’ and when you rise in the morning in which there is the morning prayer subh.
The Romans,30,18,Unto Him be praise in the heavens and the earth! - and at the sun’s decline and in the noonday.,And to Him belongs all praise in the heavens and the earth — a parenthetical statement in other words the inhabitants in both of these realms praise Him — and as the sun declines wa-‘ashiyyan is a supplement to hīna ‘when’ of the previous verse in which comes the afternoon prayer ‘asr and when you enter noontime in which comes the midday prayer zuhr.
The Romans,30,19,"He bringeth forth the living from the dead, and He bringeth forth the dead from the living, and He reviveth the earth after her death. And even so will ye be brought forth.",He brings forth the living from the dead as in the case of the human being who is produced from a sperm-drop and a bird from an egg and He brings forth the dead a sperm-drop or an egg from the living and He revives the earth with vegetation after it has died dried out. And in such a manner of being brought forth you shall be brought forth from the graves read either as the active takhrujūna ‘you shall come forth’ or the passive tukhrajūna ‘you shall be brought forth’.
The Romans,30,20,"And of His signs is this: He created you of dust, and behold you human beings, ranging widely!",And of His signs exalted be He indicating His power is that He created you in other words your origin Adam of dust then lo! you are human beings of flesh and blood spreading across the earth.
The Romans,30,21,"And of His signs is this: He created for you helpmeets from yourselves that ye might find rest in them, and He ordained between you love and mercy. Lo! herein indeed are portents for folk who reflect.",And of His signs is that He created for you from yourselves mates — Eve was created from Adam’s rib and the remainder of mankind from the reproductive fluids of men and women — that you might find peace by their side and become intimate with them and He ordained between you all affection and mercy. Surely in that mentioned there are signs for a people who reflect upon God’s handiwork exalted be He.
The Romans,30,22,"And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth, and the difference of your languages and colours. Lo! herein indeed are portents for men of knowledge.",And of His signs is the creation of the heavens and the earth and the differences of your tongues that is your languages such as Arabic non-Arabic and so on and your colours such as white or black or otherwise even though all of you are originally the offspring of the same man and woman. Surely in that there are signs indications of His power exalted be He for all peoples this may be vocalised either as li’l-‘ālamīna or li’l-‘ālimīna so it means either rational creatures or people of knowledge respectively.
The Romans,30,23,"And of His signs is your slumber by night and by day, and your seeking of His bounty. Lo! herein indeed are portents for folk who heed.",And of His signs is your sleep by night and day by His will as a repose for you and your seeking during the day of His bounty in other words your going about freely in order to seek a living is by His will. Surely in that there are signs for people who listen listening in a way so as to be prompted to reflect and take heed.
The Romans,30,24,"And of His signs is this: He showeth you the lightning for a fear and for a hope, and sendeth down water from the sky, and thereby quickeneth the earth after her death. Lo! herein indeed are portents for folk who understand.",And of His signs is His showing you lightning to arouse fear in the traveller of storms and hope in the one not travelling of the coming of the rain; and He sends down water from the heaven and with it He revives the earth after it has died that is after it has dried out so that it produces vegetation once again. Surely in that mentioned there are signs for people who understand a people who reflect.
The Romans,30,25,"And of His signs is this: The heavens and the earth stand fast by His command, and afterward, when He calleth you, lo! from the earth ye will emerge.",And of His signs is that the heaven and the earth remain standing by His command by His will without any supports; then when He calls you to come out of the earth when Isrāfīl blows the Horn for the raising from the graves to commence lo! you shall come forth from it alive. Thus your coming forth out of it by a call constitutes one of His many signs exalted be He.
The Romans,30,26,Unto Him belongeth whosoever is in the heavens and the earth. All are obedient unto Him.,And to Him belongs whoever is in the heavens and the earth as possessions creatures and servants. All are obedient to Him.
The Romans,30,27,"He it is Who produceth creation, then reproduceth it, and it is easier for Him. His is the Sublime Similitude in the heavens and the earth. He is the Mighty, the Wise.",And He it is Who initiates the creation of mankind then brings it back after their destruction and that is even easier for Him than the initiation — from the perspective of those addressed for whom to repeat something is easier than doing it for the first time — otherwise in God’s case exalted be He both are just as easy. His is the loftiest description in the heavens and the earth the most sublime attribute namely that ‘there is no god except God’. And He is the Mighty in His kingdom the Wise in His creation.
The Romans,30,28,"He coineth for you a similitude of yourselves. Have ye, from among those whom your right hands possess, partners in the wealth We have bestowed upon you, equal with you in respect thereof, so that ye fear them as ye fear each other (that ye ascribe unto Us partners out of that which We created) ? Thus We display the revelations for people who have sense.",He has struck He has coined for you O idolaters a similitude that is actually drawn from yourselves and it is as follows do you have among those whom your right hands own that is to say among your servants any partners of yourselves who may share in what We have provided for you of property and so on so that you and they are equal therein fearing them as you fear your own folk just as you fear those free men like you? the interrogative is meant as a negation in other words ‘your servants are not partners of yours in what you own so how can you make some of God’s servants partners of His. So We detail the signs so We explain them in such detail for people who understand a people who reflect.
The Romans,30,29,"Nay, but those who do wrong follow their own lusts without knowledge. Who is able to guide him whom Allah hath sent astray ? For such there are no helpers.",Nay but those who do evil through idolatry follow their own desires without any knowledge. So who will guide he whom God has led astray? that is to say he will have none to guide him. And they have no helpers no protectors against God’s chastisement.
The Romans,30,30,"So set thy purpose (O Muhammad) for religion as a man by nature upright - the nature (framed) of Allah, in which He hath created man. There is no altering (the laws of) Allah’s creation. That is the right religion, but most men know not -",So set your purpose O Muhammad (s) for religion as a hanīf as one inclining to it — in other words devote your religion you and whoever follows you purely to God — a nature given by God upon which He originated mankind and this nature is His religion in other words adhere to it. There is no changing God’s creation His religion that is to say do not change it by becoming idolaters. That is the upright religion the belief in God’s Oneness but most people namely the Meccan disbelievers do not know anything of God’s Oneness —
The Romans,30,31,"Turning unto Him (only); and be careful of your duty unto Him and establish worship, and be not of those who ascribe partners (unto Him);",turning referring to Him exalted be He concerning what He has commanded and what He has forbidden munībīna ‘turning’ is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of the verb aqim ‘set up’ in other words addressing the third plural person aqīmū ‘set up’ and fear Him and establish prayer and do not be among the idolaters
The Romans,30,32,"Of those who split up their religion and became schismatics, each sect exulting in its tenets.",of those mina’lladhīna is a substitution for al-mushrikīna ‘idolaters’ using the same operator of the oblique min who have divided up their religion by being at variance over what they worship and have become dissenting factions sects divided over this matter each party among them rejoicing delighting in what they have a variant reading for farraqū is fāraqū in other words ‘of those who have parted with the religion to which they have been commanded’.
The Romans,30,33,"And when harm toucheth men they cry unto their Lord, turning to Him in repentance; then, when they have tasted of His mercy, behold! some of them attribute partners to their Lord",And when some distress some hardship befalls people that is people such as the Meccan disbelievers they call on their Lord turning returning in penitence to Him alone. Then when He lets them taste mercy from Him by way of rain lo! a party of them ascribe partners to their Lord.
The Romans,30,34,"So as to disbelieve in that which We have given them. (Unto such it is said): Enjoy yourselves awhile, but ye will come to know.",Let them be ungrateful for what We have given them this is an imperative meant as a threat. ‘So take your enjoyment. Soon you will know’ the consequences of your enjoyment there is a shift away from the third person address to the second.
The Romans,30,35,Or have We revealed unto them any warrant which speaketh of that which they associate with Him ?,Or am the hamza here is meant for denial have We revealed any warrant any argument or scripture to them which might speak a token speech of what they associate with Him? in other words commanding them to associate others with God? No!
The Romans,30,36,"And when We cause mankind to taste of mercy they rejoice therein; but if an evil thing befall them as the consequence of their own deeds, lo! they are in despair!",And when We let people that is people such as the disbelievers of Mecca and others taste some mercy some grace they exult in it an exultation of arrogance. But if some evil some hardship befalls them for what their own hands have sent ahead behold! they despair of mercy. It is in the nature of a believer to give thanks in times of grace and to hope for mercy from his Lord in times of hardship.
The Romans,30,37,"See they not that Allah enlargeth the provision for whom He will, and straiteneth (it for whom He will). Lo! herein indeed are portents for folk who believe.",Have they not seen have they not realised that God extends He makes abundant His provision to whomever He will as a test and straitens? and He restricts it for whomever He will as a trial? Surely in that there are signs for people who believe in them.
The Romans,30,38,"So give to the kinsman his due, and to the needy, and to the wayfarer. That is best for those who seek Allah’s Countenance. And such are they who are successful.",And give the relative what is his due in the way of dutifulness and kindness and the needy and the wayfarer the traveller give voluntary alms — the Prophet’s community must emulate him in this respect. That is better for those who desire God’s Countenance who desire His reward in exchange for what they do; those they are the successful the winners.
The Romans,30,39,"That which ye give in usury in order that it may increase on (other) people’s property hath no increase with Allah; but that which ye give in charity, seeking Allah’s Countenance, hath increase manifold.",And what you give in usury — such as when something is given as a gift or a present for the purpose of demanding more in return; it the practice of usury ribā is referred to by the same noun denoting that illicit ‘extra’ ziyāda requested in the financial transaction — that it may increase the wealth of the people giving it does not increase with God — there is no reward in it for those who give it. But what you give as alms zakāt as voluntary alms sadaqa seeking thereby God’s Countenance such of you who do so — they are the receivers of manifold increase in their reward for what they sought there is here a shift of address away from the second person.
The Romans,30,40,"Allah is He Who created you and then sustained you, then causeth you to die, then giveth life to you again. Is there any of your (so- called) partners (of Allah) that doeth aught of that ? Praised and Exalted be He above what they associate (with Him)!",God is the One Who created you then provided for you then makes you die then gives you life is there anyone among your associates of those whom you have associated with God who does anything of the kind? No! Glory be to Him and exalted be He above what they associate with Him.
The Romans,30,41,"Corruption doth appear on land and sea because of (the evil) which men’s hands have done, that He may make them taste a part of that which they have done, in order that they may return.",Corruption has appeared on land in the wastelands because of the rain being withheld and the vegetation diminishing and on sea in lands near rivers because of their waters diminishing because of what people’s hands have perpetrated of acts of disobedience that He may make them taste li-yudhīqahum; or may be read li-nudhīqahum ‘that We may make them taste’ something of what they have done that is the punishment for it that perhaps they may repent.
The Romans,30,42,"Say (O Muhammad, to the disbelievers): Travel in the land, and see the nature of the consequence for those who were before you! Most of them were idolaters.",Say to the Meccan disbelievers ‘Travel in the land and behold how was the consequence for those who were before; most of them were idolaters’ and so they were destroyed because of their idolatry and their dwellings and habitations lie desolate in ruin.
The Romans,30,43,"So set thy purpose resolutely for the right religion, before the inevitable day cometh from Allah. On that day mankind will be sundered-",So set your purpose for the upright religion the religion of Islam before there comes the inevitable day from God namely the Day of Resurrection. On that day they shall be sundered yassadda‘ūna the original tā’ yatasadda‘ūna has been assimilated with the sād that is they will be split into separate groups after the Reckoning destined for Paradise or the Fire.
The Romans,30,44,"Whoso disbelieveth must (then) bear the consequences of his disbelief, while those who do right make provision for themselves -",Whoever disbelieves the consequence of his disbelief shall upon him that is the evil consequences of his disbelief which will be his being punished in the Fire and those who act righteously they will be paving the way for the salvation of their own souls preparing their places in Paradise
The Romans,30,45,That He may reward out of His bounty those who believe and do good works. Lo! He loveth not the disbelievers (in His guidance).,that He may requite li-yajziya is semantically connected to yassadda‘ūna ‘they shall be sundered’ those who believe and perform righteous deeds out of His bounty that He may reward them. Indeed He does not like the disbelievers in other words He will punish them.
The Romans,30,46,"And of His signs is this: He sendeth herald winds to make you taste His mercy, and that the ships may sail at His command, and that ye may seek his favour, and that haply ye may be thankful.",And of His signs exalted be He is that He unleashes the winds as bearers of good tidings meaning so that they may bring you good tidings of rain and that He may let you taste thereby of His mercy namely in the way of rain and fertile soil and that the ships may run thereby by His command by His will and that you may seek that you may request of His bounty provision by way of commerce at sea and that perhaps you might then give thanks for these graces O people of Mecca and so affirm His Oneness.
The Romans,30,47,Verily We sent before thee (Muhammad) messengers to their own folk. Then we took vengeance upon those who were guilty (in regard to them). To help believers is ever incumbent upon Us.,And verily We sent before you messengers to their people and they brought them clear signs plain proofs of their sincerity concerning their Message to them but they denied them. Then We took vengeance upon those who were guilty We destroyed those who denied them and it was ever incumbent upon Us to give victory to the believers over the disbelievers by destroying these and delivering the believers.
The Romans,30,48,"Allah is He Who sendeth the winds so that they raise clouds, and spreadeth them along the sky as pleaseth Him, and causeth them to break and thou seest the rain downpouring from within them. And when He maketh it to fall on whom He will of His bondmen, lo! they rejoice;",God is the One Who unleashes the winds which then raise stir up clouds and He then spreads them across the heaven as He will in small or large quantities and He forms them into fragments read kisafan or kisfan ‘scattered pieces’ then you see the rain issuing out of them that is out of the midst of them. Then when He drops it the rain upon whomever of His servants He will lo! they rejoice they are happy because of the rain.
The Romans,30,49,"Though before that, even before it was sent down upon them, they were in despair.",Though indeed before it was sent down upon them before that min qablihi is repeated for emphasis they had been despondent despairing of its sending down.
The Romans,30,50,"Look, therefore, at the prints of Allah’s mercy (in creation): how He quickeneth the earth after her death. Lo! He verily is the Quickener of the Dead, and He is Able to do all things.",So behold the effects a variant reading has singular athar ‘the effect’ of God's mercy that is His grace in giving them rain how He revives the earth after it has died after it has dried out so that it produces vegetation again. Surely He is the Reviver of the dead and He has power over all things.
The Romans,30,51,"And if We sent a wind and they beheld it yellow, they verily would still continue in their disbelief.",But if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths We unleash a different wind that damages vegetation and they see it turn yellow they would begin la-zallū is the response to the conditional oath after that that is after its turning yellow to disbelieve to deny the grace of having been given rain.
The Romans,30,52,"For verily thou (Muhammad) canst not make the dead to hear, nor canst thou make the deaf to hear the call when they have turned to flee.",And so you cannot make the dead hear nor can you make the deaf hear the call when read al-du‘ā’a idhā pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second one that comes between it and the yā’ they go away with their backs turned.
The Romans,30,53,Nor canst thou guide the blind out of their error. Thou canst make none to hear save those who believe in Our revelations so that they surrender (unto Him).,Nor can you guide the blind out of their error. You can only make hear in a way so as to understand and accept those who believe in Our signs in the Qur’ān and have thus submitted sincere in their affirmation of God’s Oneness.

He is the Knower, the Mighty.",God is the One Who created you from a state of weakness from a ‘base fluid’ cf. Q. 328 then He ordained after a second weakness which is the weakness of the period of childhood strength that is the strength of youth then after strength He appointed weakness again and grey hair the weakness of old age and the grey hairs of decrepitude read vocalised as du‘f ‘weakness’ in all three places. He creates what He will of weakness and strength youth and grey hairs and He is the Knower of how to manage His creatures the Omnipotent.
The Romans,30,55,And on the day when the Hour riseth the guilty will vow that they did tarry but an hour - thus were they ever deceived.,And on the Day when the Hour comes the guilty the disbelievers shall swear that they had not remained more than an hour in the grave. God exalted be He says That is how they use to be deceived how they used to be turned away from the truth — the Resurrection — similar to the way in which they have now been turned away from the real truth about how long they had remained.
The Romans,30,56,"But those to whom knowledge and faith are given will say: The truth is, ye have tarried, by Allah’s decree, until the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day of Resurrection, but ye used not to know.",But those who have been given knowledge and faith of angels and others shall say ‘You have remained according to God’s decree in accordance with what He had decreed for you in His prior knowledge until the Day of Resurrection. This is the Day of Resurrection which you rejected but you did not know’ that it would come to pass.
The Romans,30,57,"In that day their excuses will not profit those who did injustice, nor will they be allowed to make amends.",So on that day their excuses for denying it will not profit read lā yanfa‘u or lā tanfa‘u the evildoers nor will they be asked to make amends yusta‘tabūna means ‘they will not be asked for al-‘utbā’ which denotes ‘a return to that which pleases God’.
The Romans,30,58,"Verily We have coined for mankind in this Qur’an all kinds of similitudes; and indeed if thou camest unto them with a miracle, those who disbelieve would verily exclaim: Ye are but tricksters!",And verily We have struck We have coined for mankind in this Qur’ān every kind of similitude as a way of cautioning them. And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you O Muhammad (s) were to bring them a miraculous sign such as the staff or the hand in the case of Moses those who disbelieve from among them will certainly say la-yaqūlanna the indicative nūn has been omitted because of the other nūn coming after it and likewise the wāw replaced by the damma in lu because of two unvocalised consonants coming together and it indicates the plural person ‘You — in other words Muhammad (s) and his Companions — are nothing but followers of falsehood’.
The Romans,30,59,Thus doth Allah seal the hearts of those who know not.,Thus does God seal the hearts of those who do not know anything of God’s Oneness in the same way that He has sealed the hearts of these aforementioned individuals.
The Romans,30,60,"So have patience (O Muhammad)! Allah’s promise is the very truth, and let not those who have no certainty make thee impatient.",So be patient. Surely God’s promise to give you victory over them is true. And do not let them cause you to be inconstant those who are uncertain of the Resurrection in other words do not let them cause you to succumb to inconstancy and frivolity by abandoning patience that is to say do not abandon it.
Luqmân,31,1,Alif. Lam. Mim.,Alif lām mīm God knows best what He means by these letters.
Luqmân,31,2,"These are revelations of the wise Scripture,",Those namely these signs are the signs of the wise Book the Qur’ān the one containing wisdom the genitive annexation āyātu’l-kitābi’l-hakīm has the partitive meaning of min ‘from’;
Luqmân,31,3,"A guidance and a mercy for the good,",it is a guidance and a mercy read nominative rahmatun; the popular accusative reading rahmatan would make it a circumstantial qualifier referring to āyāt ‘signs’ the operator of which being the implicit demonstrative import of tilka ‘those’ for the virtuous
Luqmân,31,4,Those who establish worship and pay the poor-due and have sure faith in the Hereafter.,who maintain the prayer alladhīna yuqīmūna’l-salāta an explication of al-muhsinīna ‘the virtuous’ and pay the alms and who are certain of the Hereafter the repetition of hum ‘they’ here translated ‘who’ is for emphasis.
Luqmân,31,5,Such have guidance from their Lord. Such are the successful.,Such follow guidance from their Lord and it is they who are the successful the winners.
Luqmân,31,6,"And of mankind is he who payeth for mere pastime of discourse, that he may mislead from Allah’s way without knowledge, and maketh it the butt of mockery. For such there is a shameful doom.",And among people there is he who purchases idle talk in other words that part of it which diverts people from its true significance that he may lead people astray read li-yadilla; or li-yudilla from the way of God the religion of Islam without knowledge and take it read subjunctive wa-yattakhidhahā as a supplement to yudilla ‘that he may lead astray’; or indicative wa-yattakhidhuhā as a supplement to yashtarī ‘who buys’ in mockery as something to be mocked. For such there will be a humiliating chastisement one of abasement.
Luqmân,31,7,"And when Our revelations are recited unto him he turneth away in pride as if he heard them not, as if there were a deafness in his ears. So give him tidings of a painful doom.",And when Our signs in other words in the Qur’ān are recited to such a one he turns away disdainfully as though he never heard them as though there were a deafness in his ears both comparisons constitute two circumstantial qualifiers referring to the subject of the verb wallā ‘turns away’; or it is that the second comparison is an explication of the first. So give him tidings of inform him of a painful chastisement. The use of the expression ‘good tidings’ meant derisively against such a person — this was al-Nadr b. al-Hārith. He used to visit al-Hīra for commerce and purchase books containing the stories of the non-Arab peoples and then recount these to the people of Mecca. He would say ‘Muhammad recounts to you the stories of ‘Ād and Thamūd whereas I relate to you the stories of the Persians and the Byzantines!’ They would thus go to enjoy his stories and neglect to listen to the Qur’ān.
Luqmân,31,8,"Lo! those who believe and do good works, for them are the gardens of delight,",Surely those who believe and perform righteous deeds for them there shall be Gardens of Bliss
Luqmân,31,9,"Wherein they will abide. It is a promise of Allah in truth. He is the Mighty, the Wise.",abiding therein khālidīna fīhā is a circumstantial qualification of a future status in other words their abiding therein will have been ordained once they enter it — a promise of God in truth that is to say God promised them this and realised it in truth; and He is the Mighty Whom nothing can overwhelm and so prevent Him from fulfilling His promise and His threat of chastisement the Wise the One Who assigns all things to their rightful places.
Luqmân,31,10,"He hath created the heavens without supports that ye can see, and hath cast into the earth firm hills, so that it quake not with you; and He hath dispersed therein all kinds of beasts. And We send down water from the sky and We cause (plants) of every goodly kind to grow therein.",He created the heavens without any pillars that you can see ‘amad is the plural of ‘imād which is an ustuwāna ‘a column’ — this is the truth since there are no actual pillars — and cast high mountains into the earth lest it shake with you and He dispersed therein all kinds beasts. And We sent down there is a shift from the third to the second person water from the heaven and We caused to grow in it of every splendid kind every fair specimen.
Luqmân,31,11,"This is the Creation of Allah. Now show me that which those (ye worship) beside Him have created. Nay, but the wrong-doers are in error manifest!",This is God’s creation in other words what is created by Him. Now show me inform me O people of Mecca what those you worship besides Him those other than Him have created namely your gods so that you have associated them with Him exalted be He mā is an interrogative of denial and a subject; dhā has the significance of alladhī and what follows it of the relative clause is the predicate of the subject mā; arūnī glosses ‘the action’ and what follows it stands in place of two direct objects. Nay bal is for transition but the evildoers are in manifest error error that is evident because of their ascribing partners to God and you are like them.
Luqmân,31,12,"And verily We gave Luqman wisdom, saying: Give thanks unto Allah; and whosoever giveth thanks, he giveth thanks for (the good of) his soul. And whosoever refuseth - Lo! Allah is Absolute, Owner of Praise.",And verily We gave Luqmān wisdom comprising knowledge religiousness and right-mindedness in speech; his many wisdoms are well-known. He used to give legal opinions in matters of religion before David was summoned to prophethood but lived on into the latter’s summoning. He then took to acquiring knowledge from him David and refrained from giving any more legal opinions explaining this thus ‘Should I not be content if someone like the prophet David has spared me the trouble?’ He was once asked ‘What is the worst kind of person?’ He said ‘The one who does not care that people should see him doing evil’. In other words We gave him wisdom and We said to him ‘Give thanks to God for the wisdom that He has given you. Whoever gives thanks only for his own sake because the reward for his gratitude shall be his and whoever is ungrateful for a grace then surely God is Independent without need of His creation Praised’ in what He does.
Luqmân,31,13,"And (remember) when Luqman said unto his son, when he was exhorting him: O my dear son! Ascribe no partners unto Allah. Lo! to ascribe partners (unto Him) is a tremendous wrong -",And mention when Luqmān said to his son when he was admonishing him ‘O my son yā bunayya is an affectionate diminutive of yā ibnī do not ascribe partners to God idolatry is truly a tremendous wrong’ so return to him in repentance and submit to Him.
Luqmân,31,14,"And We have enjoined upon man concerning his partners - His mother beareth him in weakness upon weakness, and his weaning is in two years - Give thanks unto Me and unto thy parents. Unto Me is the journeying.",And We have enjoined man concerning his parents We commanded him to be dutiful towards them — his mother bears him and weakens in weakness after weakness that is to say she is weakened by the pregnancy the pains of labour and the delivery; and his weaning is in two years and We said to him to man ‘Give thanks to Me and to your parents. To Me is the journey’s end the return.
Luqmân,31,15,"But if they strive with thee to make thee ascribe unto Me as partner that of which thou hast no knowledge, then obey them not.

Then to Me will be your return and I will inform you of what you used to do and requite you for it the entire sentence containing the ‘enjoinder’ verse 14 and what comes after it constitutes a parenthetical statement.
Luqmân,31,16,"O my dear son! Lo! though it be but the weight of a grain of mustard-seed, and though it be in a rock, or in the heavens, or in the earth, Allah will bring it forth. Lo! Allah is Subtile, Aware.",‘O my son! Even if it namely the evil trait should be the weight of a grain of mustard-seed and even if it be in a rock or in the heavens or in the earth in other words in the most concealed place therein God will bring it forth and He will call that person to account for it. Truly God is Subtle in bringing it forth Aware of its location.
Luqmân,31,17,"O my dear son! Establish worship and enjoin kindness and forbid iniquity, and persevere whatever may befall thee. Lo! that is of the steadfast heart of things.",O my son! Establish prayer and enjoin decency and forbid indecency. And be patient through whatever may befall you as a result of such enjoining and forbidding. Truly that which is mentioned is true constancy in other words that is one of those necessary things regarding which one must have firm resolve.
Luqmân,31,18,"Turn not thy cheek in scorn toward folk, nor walk with pertness in the land. Lo! Allah loveth not each braggart boaster.",And do not turn your cheek disdainfully from people tusa‘‘ir a variant reading has tusā‘ir do not turn your face away in disdain and do not walk upon the earth exultantly in other words with haughtiness. Truly God does not like any swaggering braggart strutting in his step boasting in front of people.
Luqmân,31,19,Be modest in thy bearing and subdue thy voice. Lo! the harshest of all voices is the voice of the ass.,And be modest in your bearing being moderate in it neither dragging slowly nor rushing but peaceful and dignified and lower your voice; indeed the most hideous of voices is the donkey’s voice’ beginning its hideous bray with an exhalation and ending with an inhalation.
Luqmân,31,20,"See ye not how Allah hath made serviceable unto you whatsoever is in the skies and whatsoever is in the earth and hath loaded you with His favours both without and within ? Yet of mankind is he who disputeth concerning Allah, without knowledge or guidance or a scripture giving light.",Do you not see do you not realise O you who are being addressed that God has disposed for you whatever is in the heavens such as the sun the moon and the stars that you may benefit from them and whatever is in the earth of fruits rivers and animals and He has showered He has made abundant and made complete His favours upon you both outwardly namely by giving you your wholesome form even limbs and otherwise and inwardly? that is by giving you knowledge and so on. Yet among people that is people such as the Meccan disbelievers there are those who dispute concerning God without any knowledge or guidance from a messenger or an illuminating scripture revealed by God rather they dispute by blindly imitating others.
Luqmân,31,21,"And if it be said unto them: Follow that which Allah hath revealed, they say: Nay, but we follow that wherein we found our fathers. What! Even though the devil were inviting them unto the doom of flame ?",And if it is said to them ‘Follow what God has revealed’ they say ‘We will rather follow what we found our fathers following’. He exalted be He says What! Would they follow such things even though Satan were calling them to the chastisement of the Blaze? that is to what will bring it about necessarily? No!
Luqmân,31,22,"Whosoever surrendereth his purpose to Allah while doing good, he verily hath grasped the firm hand-hold. Unto Allah belongeth the sequel of all things.",And whoever surrenders his purpose to God that is whoever takes to obeying Him and is virtuous a believer in His Oneness has certainly grasped the firmest handle the stronger end which is not in danger of being severed and to God belongs the sequel of all matters their ultimate return.
Luqmân,31,23,"And whosoever disbelieveth, let not his disbelief afflict thee (O Muhammad). Unto Us is their return, and We shall tell them what they did. Lo! Allah is Aware of what is in the breasts (of men).",And whoever disbelieves then do not let his disbelief grieve you O Muhammad (s) do not be concerned with his disbelief. To Us shall be their return and We shall inform them of what they did. Truly God knows best what is in the breasts just as He knows other things and so He will requite them accordingly.
Luqmân,31,24,"We give them comfort for a little, and then We drive them to a heavy doom.",We will give them comfort in this world for a little while for the duration of the days of their lives then We will drive them in the Hereafter to a harsh chastisement namely the chastisement of the Fire from which they will find no escape.
Luqmân,31,25,If thou shouldst ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth ? they would answer: Allah. Say: Praise be to Allah! But most of them know not.,And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you were to ask them ‘Who created the heavens and the earth?’ they will surely say ‘God’ la-yaqūlunna ‘they will surely say’ the indicative nūn has been omitted because of the like sc. the nūn coming after it and likewise the wāw of the plural person because of two unvocalised consonants coming together. Say ‘Praise be to God’ for the manifestation of the definitive argument against them by the affirmation of the Oneness of God. Nay but most of them do not realise that this affirmation is an obligation upon them.
Luqmân,31,26,"Unto Allah belongeth whatsoever is in the heavens and the earth. Lo! Allah, He is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise.",To God belongs whatever is in the heavens and the earth as possessions creatures and servants and so none other than Him deserves to be worshipped in them. Indeed God He is the Independent without need of His creatures the Praised in His actions.
Luqmân,31,27,"And if all the trees in the earth were pens, and the sea, with seven more seas to help it, (were ink), the words of Allah could not be exhausted. Lo! Allah is Mighty, Wise.",And if all the trees on earth were pens and the sea wa’l-bahru is a supplement to mā the subject of anna replenished with seven more seas were ink the Words of God would not be spent those words expressing all the things He knows written in those pens with that amount of ink or with even more ink than that would not be spent for His knowledge exalted be He is infinite. Truly God is Mighty nothing being beyond Him Wise from Whose knowledge and wisdom nothing escapes.

Allah is Hearer, Knower.",Your creation and your resurrection are only as that of a single soul in terms of creation and resurrection because it is the result of the words kun fa-yakūn ‘“Be!” and it is!’ Truly God is Hearer hearing everything that may be heard Seer seeing everything that may be seen nothing able to distract Him from anything else.
Luqmân,31,29,"Hast thou not seen how Allah causeth the night to pass into the day and causeth the day to pass into the night, and hath subdued the sun and the moon (to do their work), each running unto an appointed term; and that Allah is Informed of what ye do ?",Have you not seen have you not realised O you being addressed that God makes the night pass into the day and makes the day pass into the night such that the increase of the one is relative to the decrease of the other and He has disposed the sun and the moon each of the two running in its course to an appointed term namely to the Day of Resurrection and that God is Aware of what you do?

Lo! therein indeed are portents for every steadfast, grateful (heart).",Have you not seen that the ships run upon the sea by the grace of God that He may show you O you who are being addressed in this statement some of His signs? Surely in that there are signs lessons for every servant who is steadfast in abstaining from acts of disobedience to God grateful for His grace.
Luqmân,31,32,"And if a wave enshroudeth them like awnings, they cry unto Allah, making their faith pure for Him only. But when He bringeth them safe to land, some of them compromise. None denieth Our signs save every traitor ingrate.",And if waves cover them that is if these rise above the disbelievers like awnings like mountains that act as awnings over those below them they call on God sincere before Him in their faith that is in their supplication that He may deliver them in other words they do not call on any other god with Him; but when He delivers them to land some of them compromise middling between belief and disbelief while others persist in their disbelief. And none denies Our signs an example of which is Our delivering them from such treacherous waves except every perfidious ingrate ungrateful for God’s graces exalted be He.
Luqmân,31,33,"O mankind! Keep your duty to your Lord and fear a Day when the parent will not be able to avail the child in aught, nor the child to avail the parent. Lo! Allah’s promise is the very truth. Let not the life of the world beguile you, nor let the deceiver beguile you, in regard to Allah.",O people namely such as the people of Mecca fear your Lord and fear a day when no parent shall avail a child thereon in any way; and no child thereon shall avail its parent in any way. Surely God’s promise of resurrection is true. So do not let the life of this world deceive you and divert you from Islam and do not let the Deceiver Satan deceive you concerning God because of His forbearance and granting people respite.
Luqmân,31,34,"Lo! Allah! With Him is knowledge of the Hour. He sendeth down the rain, and knoweth that which is in the wombs. No soul knoweth what it will earn to-morrow, and no soul knoweth in what land it will die. Lo! Allah is Knower, Aware.",Lo!

And those related by blood kinsmen are more entitled to inherit from one another in the Book of God than the other believers and the Emigrants in other words than inheriting on account of their sharing faith and the Emigration which had been the case at the beginning of Islam but was then abrogated; barring any favour you may do your friends by making a bequest which is permissible.

They were loathe to this proposal when they found out that it was on the latter’s behalf for they had thought that the Prophet s wanted to marry her himself. But afterwards they consented because of the following part of the verse And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger has certainly strayed into manifest error. Thus the Prophet s gave her in marriage to Zayd. Then on one occasion he the Prophet caught sight of her and felt love for her whereafter when he realised that Zayd lost his affection for her and so said to the Prophet s ‘I want to part with her’. But the Prophet said to him ‘Retain your wife for yourself’ as God exalted be He says
The Clans,33,37,"And when thou saidst unto him on whom Allah hath conferred favour and thou hast conferred favour: Keep thy wife to thyself, and fear Allah. And thou didst hide in thy mind that which Allah was to bring to light, and thou didst fear mankind whereas Allah hath a better right that thou shouldst fear Him. So when Zeyd had performed that necessary formality (of divorce) from her, We gave her unto thee in marriage, so that (henceforth) there may be no sin for believers in respect of wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have performed the necessary formality (of release) from them. The commandment of Allah must be fulfilled.",And when idh is dependent because of an implied preceding udhkur ‘mention when’ you said to him to whom God had shown favour by guiding him to Islam and to whom you too had shown favour by manumitting him — this was Zayd b. Hāritha who had been a prisoner of war before the coming of Islam in the period of al-jāhiliyya. The Messenger of God s purchased him before his call to prophethood and then manumitted him and adopted him as his son — ‘Retain your wife for yourself and fear God’ before divorcing her. But you had hidden in your heart what God was to disclose what He was to manifest of your love for her and of the fact that should Zayd part with her you would marry her and you feared people would say ‘He has married his son’s wife!’ though God is worthier that you should fear Him in all things so take her in marriage and do not be concerned with what people say. Zayd subsequently divorced her and her obligatory waiting period was completed. God exalted be He says So when Zayd had fulfilled whatever need he had of her We joined her in marriage to you — the Prophet consummated his marriage with her without the customary permission from her legal guardian and gratified the Muslims with a feast of bread and meat — so that there may not be any restriction for the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have fulfilled whatever wish they have of them. And God’s commandment that which He has decreed is bound to be realised.
The Clans,33,38,There is no reproach for the Prophet in that which Allah maketh his due. That was Allah’s way with those who passed away of old - and the commandment of Allah is certain destiny -,There is no restriction for the Prophet in what God has ordained in what He has made lawful for him that is God’s precedent sunnata’Llāhi is in the accusative because the operator of the oblique has been removed from the oblique construction ka-sunnati’Llāhi ‘as is God’s precedent’ with those who passed away before of prophets which is that there is no restriction for them in this respect a special dispensation for them regarding marriage — and God’s commandment what He does is inexorable destiny
The Clans,33,39,"Who delivered the messages of Allah and feared Him, and feared none save Allah. Allah keepeth good account.",— those who alladhīna qualifies the previous alladhīna deliver the Messages of God and fear Him and fear no one except Him and therefore they do not fear what people might say about that which God has made lawful for them. And God suffices as Reckoner as keeper of the deeds of His creatures and as One to reckon with them.
The Clans,33,40,"Muhammad is not the father of any man among you, but he is the messenger of Allah and the Seal of the Prophets; and Allah is ever Aware of all things.",Muhammad is not the father of any man among you he is not Zayd’s biological father and so it is not unlawful for him to marry his former wife Zaynab after him; but he is the Messenger of God and the Seal of the Prophets and so he will not have a son that is a fully grown man to be a prophet after him a variant reading for khātim al-nabiyyīna has khātam al-nabiyyīn as in the instrument known as a ‘seal’ in other words their prophethood has been sealed by him. And God has knowledge of all things among these is the fact that there will be no prophet after him and even when the lord Jesus descends at the end of days he will rule according to his Muhammad’s Law.

But provide for them give them what they can use for securing comforts in cases where no dowry has been fixed for them; otherwise theirs is to retain half of what was fixed but no more — this is what Ibn ‘Abbās said and it is the opinion followed by al-Shāfi‘ī’; and release them in a gracious manner leave them be without the intention to cause them any harm.
The Clans,33,50,"O Prophet! Lo! We have made lawful unto thee thy wives unto whom thou hast paid their dowries, and those whom thy right hand possesseth of those whom Allah hath given thee as spoils of war, and the daughters of thine uncle on the father’s side and the daughters of thine aunts on the father’s side, and the daughters of thine uncle on the mother’s side and the daughters of thine aunts on the mother’s side who emigrated with thee, and a believing woman if she give herself unto the Prophet and the Prophet desire to ask her in marriage - a privilege for thee only, not for the (rest of) believers - We are Aware of that which We enjoined upon them concerning their wives and those whom their right hands possess - that thou mayst be free from blame, for Allah is ever Forgiving, Merciful.",O Prophet! Indeed We have made lawful for you your wives whom you have given their dowries and what your right hand owns of those whom God has given you as spoils of war from the disbelievers whom you have taken captive such as Safiyya and Juwayriyya and the daughters of your paternal uncles and the daughters of your paternal aunts and the daughters of your maternal uncles and the daughters of your maternal aunts who emigrated with you as opposed to those who did not emigrate and any believing woman if she gift herself in marriage to the Prophet and if the Prophet desire to take her in marriage and ask for her hand in marriage without paying her a dowry — a privilege for you exclusively not for the rest of the believers nikāh ‘marriage’ when expressed by the term hiba ‘gift’ denotes marriage without dowry. Indeed We know what We have imposed upon them namely the believers with respect to their wives in the way of rulings to the effect that they should not take more than four wives and should only marry with the consent of a legal guardian the presence of witnesses and the payment of a dowry and with respect to what their right hands own of slavegirls in the way of purchase or otherwise so that the handmaiden be one lawful for her master such as a slavegirl belonging to the People of the Scripture kitābiyya and not a Magian or an idolater and that she should be ascertained as not carrying child with the necessary waiting period istibrā’ before copulation; so that li-kaylā is semantically connected to what came before this last statement there may be no unnecessary restriction for you no constraint in marriage for you. And God is Forgiving of what is difficult to guard against Merciful in giving dispensations allowing for latitude in this respect.
The Clans,33,51,"Thou canst defer whom thou wilt of them and receive unto thee whom thou wilt, and whomsoever thou desirest of those whom thou hast set aside (temporarily), it is no sin for thee (to receive her again); that is better; that they may be comforted and not grieve, and may all be pleased with what thou givest them.

He was given the choice in this respect after it had been obligatory for him to give each wife her equal share of conjugality. That freedom of choice makes it likelier that they will be comforted and not grieve and that they will be satisfied with what you give them of what has been mentioned of your freedom to choose whom to consort with every one of them kulluhunna emphasises the subject of the verb yardayna ‘they will be satisfied’ will be well-pleased with what you give her.

But if ye are invited, enter, and, when your meal is ended, then disperse. Linger not for conversation. Lo! that would cause annoyance to the Prophet, and he would be shy of (asking) you (to go); but Allah is not shy of the truth. And when ye ask of them (the wives of the Prophet) anything, ask it of them from behind a curtain. That is purer for your hearts and for their hearts.

As Moses chased it and took his robe to cover himself they saw that he had no such inflammation udra is an inflammation of the testicle. And he was distinguished in God’s sight.

And when he fell the jinn saw clearly how, if they had known the Unseen, they would not have continued in despised toil.",And when We decreed for him for Solomon death in other words when he died — he remained supported against his staff an entire year while the jinn continued to toil in hard labour as was customary unaware of his death until finally when a termite ate through his staff he fell to the ground and was seen to be dead — nothing indicated to them that he had died except a termite al-ard is the verbal noun from uridat al-khashaba passive verbal form in other words ‘it the piece of wood was eaten away by a termite al-arada’ that gnawed away at his staff read minsa’atahu or minsātahu replacing the hamza with an alif meaning a ‘staff’ so called because when describing it one would say yunsa’u bihā to mean it is used to repel or drive away creatures’. And when he fell down dead the jinn realised it became apparent to them that an is softened in other words annahum had they known the Unseen — comprising what was hidden from them in the way of Solomon being dead — they would not have continued in the humiliating chastisement in that hard labour of theirs in which they continued as they supposed him to be alive which is in contrast to what they would have supposed had they known the Unseen and the fact that he had been there an entire year judging by how much of the staff the termite had eaten through after his death; in other words they would not have continued in the humiliating chastisement for a single day or even a single night longer.
Saba,34,15,There was indeed a sign for Sheba in their dwelling-place: Two gardens on the right hand and the left (as who should say): Eat of the provision of your Lord and render thanks to Him. A fair land and an indulgent Lord!,Verily there was for Sheba Saba’ declined as li-Saba’in or left as indeclinable li-Saba’a is the name of a tribe that took its name from one of their Arab ancestors in their dwelling-place in Yemen a sign indicating God’s power exalted be He two gardens jannatān a substitution for āyatun ‘a sign’ to the right and to the left in other words on the right side of their valley and on its left side. And it was said to them ‘Eat of your Lord’s provision and give thanks to Him for the graces He has bestowed on you in the land of Sheba. A good land — in which there was no dung gnats flies fleas scorpions or snakes and in which when a stranger passed through with his clothes lice-infected these lice would be killed off because of the purity of its air — and God is a forgiving Lord.’
Saba,34,16,"But they were froward, so We sent on them the flood of ’Iram, and in exchange for their two gardens gave them two gardens bearing bitter fruit, the tamarisk and here and there a lote-tree.",But they were disregardful of giving thanks to Him and became disbelievers so We unleashed upon them the flood of the Dam al-‘arim is the plural of ‘arima which is a structure or something similar that holds water back to be stored for when it is needed in other words We unleashed upon them the flood-waters of their valley which had been held back by the mentioned structure so that they engulfed their two gardens together with all their property. And We gave them in place of their two gardens two gardens bearing dhawātay a dual form of feminine plural dhawāt; usually the form dhātay from the singular would have been used bitter fruit bitter and vile ukul may be read as a genitive annexation ukulin khamtin in the sense of ‘that which is eaten thereof being bitter; or it may be read without as ukuli khamtin; and this phrase is supplemented by the following wa-athlin wa-shay’in min sidrin qalīl and tamarisk and sparse lote trees.
Saba,34,17,This We awarded them because of their ingratitude. Punish We ever any save the ingrates ?,That replacement of what they had is what We requited them with for their ingratitude and is anyone but the ingrate ever so requited? read hal yujāzā illā’l-kafūru; or read as hal nujāzī illā’l-kafūra ‘Would We requite anyone but the ingrate?’ in other words it is only the like of such who is called to account.
Saba,34,18,"And We set, between them and the towns which We had blessed, towns easy to be seen, and We made the stage between them easy, (saying): Travel in them safely both by night and day.",And We set between them between Sheba who were in Yemen and the towns which We had blessed with abundance of water and trees — these being the towns of Syria to which they used to travel for commerce — prominent towns continuous along the route from Yemen to Syria and We facilitated for travellers the journeying through them such that they would rest for the afternoon in one and spend the night in the next and so on until the end of their travel having no need of any supplies or water along the way; and We said ‘Travel through them night and day safely’ having no fear by night or by day.
Saba,34,19,"But they said: Our Lord! Make the stage between our journeys longer. And they wronged themselves, therefore We made them bywords (in the land) and scattered them abroad, a total scattering. Lo! herein verily are portents for each steadfast, grateful (heart).",But they said ‘Our Lord make far apart ba‘‘id a variant reading has bā‘id the stages of our travel’ to Syria make these stages through deserts so that they could glory before the poor in riding their camels and bearing their supplies and water and so they behaved wantonly with the graces bestowed on them by God and they wronged their souls through disbelief and so We made them bywords of wrongdoing in this respect for those who came after them and We caused them to disintegrate totally We scattered them all over the lands. Surely in that which is mentioned there are signs lessons for every servant who is steadfast in refraining from acts of disobedience grateful for God’s graces.
Saba,34,20,"And Satan indeed found his calculation true concerning them, for they follow him, all save a group of true believers.",And verily Iblīs proved true read sadaqa or saddaqa his opinion of them that is of the disbelievers among them — the folk of Sheba — which was that by his tempting them to go astray they would follow him. So they followed him if the verb above is read sadaqa this would mean that ‘he was right in his opinion’ and if read saddaqa it would mean that ‘he found this opinion of his to be true’ — all except a group of the believers mina’l-mu’minīna the min ‘of’ is explicative not partitive in other words all except that group who were the believers they did not follow him.
Saba,34,21,"And he had no warrant whatsoever against them, save that We would know him who believeth in the Hereafter from him who is in doubt thereof; and thy Lord (O Muhammad) taketh note of all things.",And he did not have any warrant over them any power to sway them from Us but that We might know by this knowledge being made manifest him who believed in the Hereafter from him who was in doubt thereof and so requite each of the two accordingly. And your Lord is Preserver Watcher of all things.
Saba,34,22,"Say (O Muhammad): Call upon those whom ye set up beside Allah! They possess not an atom’s weight either in the heavens or in the earth, nor have they any share in either, nor hath He an auxiliary among them.",Say O Muhammad (s) to the disbelievers of Mecca ‘Call on those whom you have asserted those whom you have asserted to be gods besides God in other words other than Him so that they might benefit you as you are wont to assert. God exalted be He says of them They do not possess even so much as the weight of an atom of good or evil in the heavens or in the earth and they do not have any share in either of them nor has He exalted be He among them the gods any auxiliary’ anyone required as His helper.
Saba,34,23,"No intercession availeth with Him save for him whom He permitteth. Yet, when fear is banished from their hearts, they say: What was it that your Lord said ? They say: The Truth. And He is the Sublime, the Great.",And intercession will not avail with Him exalted be He — this was in response to their saying that their gods would intercede for them with Him — except for him to whom leave is given in this respect read adhina ‘to whom He gives leave’; or udhina ‘to whom leave is given’. Yet when fear is banished from their hearts read active fazza‘a or passive fuzzi‘a when fear is removed from them upon leave being given for this intercession they will say — some will say to others in anticipation of a favourable outcome — ‘What has your Lord said?’ concerning this. They will say He has said the saying that is ‘The truth’ in other words leave has been given for it. And He is the Exalted above His creation by His subjugation of them the Great the Tremendous.
Saba,34,24,"Say: Who giveth you provision from the sky and the earth ? Say: Allah, Lo! we or you assuredly are rightly guided or in error manifest.",Say ‘Who provides for you from the heavens rain and from the earth?’ vegetation. Say ‘God!’ — even if they do not say it there is no other valid answer. And indeed either we or you are — in other words either one of the two parties is — rightly guided or in manifest error. The ambiguity here concerning which of the two is rightly guided is intended as a gentle invitation for them to embrace faith if their way to it is facilitated by God.
Saba,34,25,"Say: Ye will not be asked of what we committed, nor shall we be asked of what ye do.",Say ‘You will not be questioned about the sins we committed nor shall we be questioned about what you do’ for we are quit of you.
Saba,34,26,"Say: Our Lord will bring us all together, then He will judge between us with truth. He is the All-knowing Judge.",Say ‘Our Lord will bring us together on the Day of Resurrection then He will judge between us with truth and He will admit the truthful into Paradise and the liars into the Fire. And He is the Judge the Knowing’ in what He judges.
Saba,34,27,"Say: Show me those whom ye have joined unto Him as partners. Nay (ye dare not)! For He is Allah, the Mighty, the Wise.",Say ‘Show me apprise me of those whom you have joined to Him as associates in worship. No indeed! — this is meant to deter them from even supposing that He has an associate. Rather He is God the Mighty Whose way will prevail the Wise’ in the way in which He manages the affairs of His creation and so He could not have any associate in His kingdom.
Saba,34,28,And We have not sent thee (O Muhammad) save as a bringer of good tidings and a warner unto all mankind; but most of mankind know not.,And We did not send you except to all kāffatan is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-nās ‘mankind’ and is made to precede li’l-nās because of the importance attached to it of mankind both as a bearer of good tidings to believers of Paradise and a warner to the disbelievers of chastisement but most people such as the disbelievers of Mecca do not know this.
Saba,34,29,And they say: When is this promise (to be fulfilled) if ye are truthful ?,And they say ‘When shall this promise of chastisement be fulfilled if you are being truthful?’ concerning it.
Saba,34,30,Say (O Muhammad): Yours is the promise of a Day which ye cannot postpone nor hasten by an hour.,Say ‘Yours is the tryst of a Day which you can neither defer nor advance by a single hour’ and this is the Day of Resurrection.
Saba,34,31,"And those who disbelieve say: We believe not in this Qur’an nor in that which was before it; but oh, if thou couldst see, when the wrong- doers are brought up before their Lord, how they cast the blame one to another; how those who were despised (in the earth) say unto those who were proud: But for you, we should have been believers.",And those who disbelieve from among the people of Mecca say ‘We will not believe in this Qur’ān nor in that which was revealed before it’ — in other words what preceded it such as the Torah and the Gospel both of which contain proofs of the Resurrection — because they reject the truth of this last. God exalted be He says of them But if you were to see O Muhammad (s) when the evildoers the disbelievers are brought to stand before their Lord bandying arguments against one another. Those who were oppressed — the followers — will say to those who were arrogant — the leaders ‘Had it not been for you barring us from faith we would have been believers’ in the Prophet.
Saba,34,32,"Those who were proud say unto those who were despised: Did we drive you away from the guidance after it had come unto you ? Nay, but ye were guilty.",Those who were arrogant will say to those who were oppressed ‘Was it us who barred you from guidance after it had come to you? Nay! Rather you were guilty’ of your own accord.
Saba,34,33,"Those who were despised say unto those who were proud: Nay but (it was your) scheming night and day, when ye commanded us to disbelieve in Allah and set up rivals unto Him. And they are filled with remorse when they behold the doom; and We place carcans on the necks of those who disbelieved. Are they requited aught save what they used to do ?",And those who were oppressed will say to those who were arrogant ‘Nay but it was your scheming night and day in other words such were your schemes against us during both of these times when you used to command us to disbelieve in God and set up partners with Him’. And they that is the two parties will conceal their remorse for not having believed in Him when they see the chastisement in other words each person will hide it his remorse from the next for fear of being reviled; and We will place fetters around the necks of the disbelievers while they are in the Fire. Shall they be requited except the requital for what they used to do? in the world.
Saba,34,34,"And We sent not unto any township a warner, but its pampered ones declared: Lo! we are disbelievers in that wherewith ye have been sent.",And We did not send a warner to any town without its affluent ones its leaders those enjoying life’s comforts saying ‘Indeed we disbelieve in that Message with which you have been sent’.
Saba,34,35,And they say: We are more (than you) in wealth and children. We are not the punished!,And they say ‘We possess more wealth and children than those who are believers and we shall not be chastised’.
Saba,34,36,Say (O Muhammad): Lo! my Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will and narroweth it (for whom He will). But most of mankind know not.,Say ‘Truly my Lord extends provision He makes it abundant for whomever He will as a test and restricts it for whomever He will to try them but most people such as the disbelievers of Mecca do not know’ this truth.
Saba,34,37,"And it is not your wealth nor your children that will bring you near unto Us, but he who believeth and doeth good (he draweth near). As for such, theirs will be twofold reward for what they did and they will dwell secure in lofty halls.",Nor is it your wealth or your children that will bring you near to Us in closeness except for but it is those who believe and act righteously those they shall have a twofold reward for what they did in other words they shall have it as the reward of their action — as a good deed for example is rewarded tenfold or more — and they shall be in the lofty abodes of Paradise secure from death and otherwise a variant reading for al-ghurufāt is al-ghurfa the generic noun implying a plural.
Saba,34,38,"And as for those who strive against Our revelations, challenging, they will be brought to the doom.",And those who strive against Our signs namely the Qur’ān seeking to invalidate it supposing Us to be inomnipotent — or supposing that they can elude Us — those they will be arraigned into the chastisement.
Saba,34,39,"Say: Lo! my Lord enlargeth the provision for whom He will of His bondmen, and narroweth (it) for him. And whatsoever ye spend (for good) He replaceth it. And He is the Best of Providers.",Say ‘My Lord extends provision He makes it abundant for whomever He will of His servants as a test and restricts it for him after having extended it — or He restricts it for him whom He will to try and whatever thing you may expend for the cause of good He will replace it. And He is the best of providers’. It is said that every man ‘provides for’ his dependants yarzuqu ‘ā’ilatahu meaning that he does so from the provision given to him by God.
Saba,34,40,"And on the day when He will gather them all together, He will say unto the angels: Did these worship you ?",And mention on the Day when He will gather them all together namely all the idolaters He will say to the angels ‘Was it these who used to worship you?’ read a-hā’ūlā’i iyyākum pronouncing both hamzas or by replacing the first with a yā’ or dropping it altogether.
Saba,34,41,"They will say: Be Thou Glorified. Thou (alone) art our Guardian, not them! Nay, but they worshipped the jinn; most of them were believers in them.",They will say ‘Glory be to You exalted above that You should have an associate! You are our Supporter not they in other words as far as we are concerned there are no bonds of association between us and them. Nay bal is to indicate transition rather they used to worship the jinn the devils in other words they used to obey them and agree to worship us; most of them were believers in them’ accepting as truth what these jinn used to say to them.
Saba,34,42,That day ye will possess no use nor hurt one for another. And We shall say unto those who did wrong: Taste the doom of the Fire which ye used to deny.,God exalted be He says ‘So today none among you has any power over another in other words none of those worshipped have any power over any of those who worshipped either to benefit through intercession or to hurt’ through chastisement. And We shall say to those who did wrong who disbelieved ‘Taste the chastisement of the Fire which you used to deny!’
Saba,34,43,"And if Our revelations are recited unto them in plain terms, they say: This is naught else than a man who would turn you away from what your fathers used to worship; and they say: This is naught else than an invented lie. Those who disbelieve say of the truth when it reacheth them: This is naught else than mere magic.",And when Our signs from the Qur’ān are recited to them being clear signs evident ones by the tongue of our Prophet Muhammad (s) they say ‘This is just a man who desires to bar you from worshipping what your fathers used to worship’ of idols. And they say ‘This Qur’ān is nothing but a calumny a lie that has been invented against God. And those who disbelieve say to the truth the Qur’ān when it comes to them ‘This is nothing but plain sorcery’. God exalted be He says
Saba,34,44,"And We have given them no scriptures which they study, nor sent We unto them, before thee, any warner.",And We did not give them any scriptures for them to study nor did We send them any warner before you so on what grounds do they deny you?
Saba,34,45,"Those before them denied, and these have not attained a tithe of that which We bestowed on them (of old); yet they denied My messengers. How intense then was My abhorrence (of them)!",And those who were before them also denied and they these ones the Meccans have not received even a tenth of what We gave those others in the way of might long life and abundance of wealth. Yet they denied My messengers who were sent to them so how was My abhorrence! so how was My rebuttal against them through punishment and destruction in other words it was appropriate.
Saba,34,46,"Say (unto them, O Muhammad): I exhort you unto one thing only: that ye awake, for Allah’s sake, by twos and singly, and then reflect: There is no madness in your comrade. He is naught else than a warner unto you in face of a terrific doom.",Say ‘I will give you just one piece of admonition namely that you rise up for God in other words for His sake in twos and individually and then reflect and realise that there is no madness in your companion Muhammad (s). He is just a warner to you before the befalling of a severe chastisement’ in the Hereafter if you disobey him.
Saba,34,47,Say: Whatever reward I might have asked of you is yours. My reward is the affair of Allah only. He is Witness over all things.,Say to them ‘I have not asked you in return for my warning and delivering the Message to you any reward since it is for the benefit of you in other words I do not ask you for any reward in return for this. Indeed my reward lies only with God and He is Witness over all things’ observing them all knowing my truthfulness.
Saba,34,48,Say: Lo! my Lord hurleth the truth. (He is) the Knower of Things Hidden.,Say ‘Indeed my Lord hurls the truth He casts it onto His prophets — He is the Knower of the Unseen’ of all that is hidden from His creatures throughout the heavens and the earth.
Saba,34,49,"Say: The Truth hath come, and falsehood showeth not its face and will not return.",Say ‘The truth Islam has come. And falsehood disbelief neither originates nor restores anything’ in other words it leaves no trace of itself behind.
Saba,34,50,"Say: If I err, I err only to my own loss, and if I am rightly guided it is because of that which my Lord hath revealed unto me. Lo! He is Hearer, Nigh.",Say ‘If I go astray from the truth I will be going astray only to my own loss that is to say the sin of my going astray shall be held against me; and if I am rightly guided it will have been by what my Lord reveals to me of the Qur’ān and wisdom. Truly He is Hearer of supplications Nigh’.
Saba,34,51,"Couldst thou but see when they are terrified with no escape, and are seized from near at hand,",If you could but see O Muhammad (s) when they are stricken with terror at the Resurrection you would see a dreadful thing and so there is no escape for them from Us that is to say they will not be able to elude Us and they are seized from a close quarter namely from the graves.
Saba,34,52,"And say: We (now) believe therein. But how can they reach (faith) from afar off,",And they will say ‘We believe in him now’ in other words in Muhammad (s) — or if read ‘We believe in it’ then in the Qur’ān. But how can they attain it read tanāwush or tanā’ush that is attain faith from a place that is far away from the place for attaining it — as they are now in the Hereafter and the proper place for attaining it was in this world —
Saba,34,53,When they disbelieved in it of yore. They aim at the unseen from afar off.,when they disbelieved in it before? in this world. And they throw guesses at the Unseen from a far-off place in other words they make guesses about something the knowledge of which was hidden far away from them as when they would say that the Prophet was a sorcerer or a poet or a soothsayer or that the Qur’ān was sorcery poetry or soothsaying.
Saba,34,54,"And a gulf is set between them and that which they desire, as was done for people of their kind of old. Lo! they were in hopeless doubt.",And a barrier is set between them and what they crave in the way of faith — in other words their craving to embrace it — just as was done with their counterparts in respect to disbelief formerly in other words before them. Indeed they used to be in grave doubt doubt causing them to have misgivings about that in which they now believe but the proofs for which they never considered in this world.
The Angels,35,1,"Praise be to Allah, the Creator of the heavens and the earth, Who appointeth the angels messengers having wings two, three and four. He multiplieth in creation what He will. Lo! Allah is Able to do all things.",Praise be to God God praises Himself with in these terms as explained at the beginning of the preceding sūrat Saba’ Originator of the heavens and the earth the One Who created them without any precedent Appointer of the angels as messengers to His prophets having wings in sets of two or three or four. He multiplies in creation in angels and other creatures what He will. Surely God has power over all things.
The Angels,35,2,"That which Allah openeth unto mankind of mercy none can withhold it; and that which He withholdeth none can release thereafter. He is the Mighty, the Wise.",Whatever mercy God unfolds for mankind in the way of provision or rain none can withhold it; and whatever He withholds thereof none can release it after Him that is after His withholding it. And He is the Mighty Whose way prevails the Wise in what He does.
The Angels,35,3,O mankind! Remember Allah’s grace toward you! Is there any creator other than Allah who provideth for you from the sky and the earth ? There is no God save Him. Whither then are ye turned ?,O people that is the people of Mecca remember God’s grace to you in His making you dwell within the Meccan Sanctuary and preventing raids against you. Is there any creator min khāliqin min is extra; khāliq is the subject other than God read ghayru’Llāhi or gharyri’Llāhi as an adjectival qualification of khāliq ‘creator’ either concording with the oblique form of min khāliqin or concording with the syntactical status thereof; the predicate of the subject is the following who provides for you from the heaven rain and from the earth? vegetation the interrogative is actually an affirmative that is to say ‘there is no creator or provider other than Him. There is no god except Him. So how then do you deviate? how are you turned away from affirming His Oneness when you already affirm that He is the Creator and the Provider?
The Angels,35,4,"And if they deny thee, (O Muhammad), messengers (of Allah) were denied before thee. Unto Allah all things are brought back.",And if they deny you O Muhammad (s) with regard to your coming with the message of God’s Oneness resurrection reckoning and punishment verily other messengers before you were denied in this respect so be steadfast as they were steadfast; and to God all matters are returned in the Hereafter when He will requite the deniers and grant victory to the messengers.
The Angels,35,5,"O mankind! Lo! the promise of Allah is true. So let not the life of the world beguile you, and let not the (avowed) beguiler beguile you with regard to Allah.",O mankind! Indeed God’s promise of resurrection and of other issues is true. So do not let the life of this world deceive you from believing in all of that and do not let the Deceiver Satan deceive you concerning God on account of His forbearance and respiting of sinners in this life.
The Angels,35,6,"Lo! the devil is an enemy for you, so treat him as an enemy. He only summoneth his faction to be owners of the flaming Fire.",Truly Satan is an enemy to you. So treat him as an enemy by being obedient to God and do not obey him; he only summons his faction his followers in disbelief so that they may be among the inhabitants of the Blaze the fierce Fire.
The Angels,35,7,"Those who disbelieve, theirs will be an awful doom; and those who believe and do good works, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward.",Those who disbelieve theirs will be a severe chastisement; but those who believe and perform righteous deeds theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward — this is a declaration of what fate will be for the adherents of Satan and what will be for his opponents respectively.
The Angels,35,8,"Is he, the evil of whose deeds is made fairseeming unto him so that he deemeth it good, (other than Satan’s dupe) ? Allah verily sendeth whom He will astray, and guideth whom He will; so let not thy soul expire in sighings for them. Lo! Allah is Aware of what they do!",The following was revealed regarding Abū Jahl and others Is he the evil of whose deeds is made to seem fair to him by distortion so that he deems it good …? a-fa-man ‘is he whose’ constitutes the subject the predicate of which is an omitted ‘like one whom God has guided?’ No! And this predicate is indicated by what follows. Indeed God leads astray whomever He will and guides whomever He will. So do not let your soul expire for their sake for those to whom it has made to seem fair out of sighings by becoming anguished lest they do not believe. Indeed God is Knower of what they do and He will requite them for it.
The Angels,35,9,And Allah it is Who sendeth the winds and they raise a cloud; then We lead it unto a dead land and revive therewith the earth after its death. Such is the Resurrection.,And it is God Who unleashes the winds al-riyāha a variant reading has al-rīha and they raise clouds fa-tuthīru’l-sahāba the imperfect tense here is used to narrate the past that is they stir them up then We drive them there is a shift here from the third person to the first person address to a dead land read mayyitin or maytin wherein is no plant life and therewith revive the earth of that land after it has been dead after its having been dried-out. In other words We made seeds and grass grow in it Such will be the Raising that is the Resurrection and the bringing of the dead back to life.
The Angels,35,10,"Whoso desireth power (should know that) all power belongeth to Allah. Unto Him good words ascend, and the pious deed doth He exalt; but those who plot iniquities, theirs will be an awful doom; and the plotting of such (folk) will come to naught.",Whoever desires glory should know that all glory belongs to God in this world and in the Hereafter and it cannot be obtained from Him except through obedience to Him so let such a one be obedient to Him. To Him ascends good words that is to say He is aware of such good words and these are statements such as ‘there is no god except God’ and the like; and as for righteous action He exalts it He accepts it; but those who plot evil schemes against the Prophet — as was the case at the council assembly in the way of imprisoning him killing him or expelling him as mentioned in sūrat al-Anfāl Q. 830 — theirs shall be a severe chastisement and their plotting shall come to nothing it shall be ruined.
The Angels,35,11,"Allah created you from dust, then from a little fluid, then He made you pairs (the male and female). No female beareth or bringeth forth save with His knowledge. And no-one groweth old who groweth old, nor is aught lessened of his life, but it is recorded in a Book, Lo! that is easy for Allah.",And God created you from dust by having created your father Adam from it then from a drop of seminal fluid in other words from sperm by creating his seed from it; then He made you pairs males and females. And no female bears or brings forth except with His knowledge illā bi-‘ilmihi is a circumstantial qualifier in other words ‘except that it is known by Him’ and no long-living person is given long life in other words the life of none is increased for one who has a long life nor is anything diminished of his life in other words of the life of that same long-living person or some other long-living person but it is recorded in a Book namely the Preserved Tablet. Surely that is easy for God.
The Angels,35,12,"And the two seas are not alike: this, fresh, sweet, good to drink, this (other) bitter, salt. And from them both ye eat fresh meat and derive the ornament that ye wear. And thou seest the ship cleaving them with its prow that ye may seek of His bounty, and that haply ye may give thanks.",Nor are the two kinds of seas alike this one is extremely sweet pleasant to drink and that one is salty extremely bitter. Yet from each of the two you eat fresh meat namely fish and obtain from the salt — and it is also said from both of them — ornaments which you wear namely pearls and coral. And you see you sight the ships therein in each of the two seas ploughing through mawākhira in other words tamkhuru’l-mā’a meaning ‘it cleaves it as it makes its way through it coming and going by the same wind that you may seek of His bounty exalted be He through commerce and that perhaps you may give thanks to God for this bounty.
The Angels,35,13,"He maketh the night to pass into the day and He maketh the day to pass into the night. He hath subdued the sun and moon to service. Each runneth unto an appointed term. Such is Allah, your Lord; His is the Sovereignty; and those unto whom ye pray instead of Him own not so much as the white spot on a date-stone.",He God makes the night pass enter into the day so that it becomes longer and He makes the day pass into the night so that it becomes longer and He has disposed the sun and the moon each of them moving in its course to an appointed term — to the Day of Resurrection. That is God your Lord; to Him belongs all sovereignty. As for those on whom you call whom you worship besides Him in other words other than Him — and they are the idols — they do not possess even so much as the husk of a date-stone.
The Angels,35,14,"If ye pray unto them they hear not your prayer, and if they heard they could not grant it you. On the Day of Resurrection they will disown association with you. None can inform you like Him Who is Aware.",If you call on them they will not hear your call and even if they heard —hypothetically speaking — they would not be able to respond to you; and on the Day of Resurrection they will disown your idolatrous associations in other words your associating them with God in power that is to say they will declare themselves innocent of you and of your worship of them. And none can inform you about the state in the two abodes like One Who is Aware Knower and this is God exalted be He.
The Angels,35,15,"O mankind! Ye are the poor in your relation to Allah. And Allah! He is the Absolute, the Owner of Praise.",O mankind! You are the ones who are in need of God in every state. And God He is the Independent without any need of His creatures the Praised the One Who is praised in whatever He does with them.
The Angels,35,16,"If He will, He can be rid of you and bring (instead of you) some new creation.",If He will He can take you away and bring about a new creation instead of you.
The Angels,35,17,That is not a hard thing for Allah.,And that is not an arduous thing for God.
The Angels,35,18,"And no burdened soul can bear another’s burden, and if one heavy laden crieth for (help with) his load, naught of it will be lifted even though he (unto whom he crieth) be of kin. Thou warnest only those who fear their Lord in secret, and have established worship. He who groweth (in goodness), groweth only for himself, (he cannot by his merit redeem others). Unto Allah is the journeying.",And no burdened soul shall bear the burden of another sinful soul. And should one soul burdened heavily with sin call for some of its burden to be borne by another nothing of it will be borne even if the one called be a relative kin such as a father or a son — the impossibility of ‘having something borne by another’ in both instances is something ordained by God. You can only warn those who fear their Lord in secret in other words those who fear Him despite not having seen Him for they are the ones to benefit from the warning and observe the prayer maintain performance of it. For whoever purifies himself cleansing himself of idolatry and other similar abominations is purifying himself only for the sake of his own soul because the reforming of his self pertains to him. And to God is the end of the journeying the return in the Hereafter when He will requite according to deeds.

The Angels,35,22,Nor are the living equal with the dead. Lo! Allah maketh whom He will to hear. Thou canst not reach those who are in the graves.,nor are the living equal to the dead the believers and the disbelievers respectively the addition of the particle lā ‘nor’ in all three instances is for emphasis. Indeed God makes to hear whomever He will to be guided so that such a person then responds to Him by embracing faith. But you cannot make those who are in the graves to hear namely the disbelievers — whom He has likened to the dead — to hear and so respond.
The Angels,35,23,Thou art but a warner.,You are but a warner to them.
The Angels,35,24,"Lo! We have sent thee with the Truth, a bearer of glad tidings and a warner; and there is not a nation but a warner hath passed among them.",Truly We have sent you with the truth with right guidance as a bearer of good tidings to him who responds to it and a warner to him who does not respond to it. And there is not a community but there has passed there has been in it a warner a prophet to warn it.

The Angels,35,28,"And of men and beasts and cattle, in like manner, divers hues ? The erudite among His bondmen fear Allah alone. Lo! Allah is Mighty, Forgiving.",And of humans and beasts and cattle there are diverse hues likewise like the diversity of the hues of fruits and mountains. Indeed only those of God’s servants who have knowledge fear Him in contrast to the ignorant such as the disbelievers of Mecca. Truly God is Mighty in His kingdom Forgiving of the sins of His faithful servants.
The Angels,35,29,"Lo! those who read the Scripture of Allah, and establish worship, and spend of that which We have bestowed on them secretly and openly, they look forward to imperishable gain,",Indeed those who recite the Book of God and observe prayer they maintain performance of it and expend of what We have provided them secretly and openly to give as alms and otherwise anticipate a commerce that will never be ruined
The Angels,35,30,"That He will pay them their wages and increase them of His grace. Lo! He is Forgiving, Responsive.",that He may pay them in full their rewards the reward for their mentioned deeds and enrich them out of His bounty.

The Angels,35,31,"As for that which We inspire in thee of the Scripture, it is the Truth confirming that which was (revealed) before it. Lo! Allah is indeed Observer, Seer of His slaves.",And that which We have revealed to you of the Book the Qur’ān is the truth confirming what was revealed before it in other words confirming the Books that came before it. Indeed with regard to His servants God is truly Aware and Seeing knowing both their inward and outward aspects.
The Angels,35,32,"Then We gave the Scripture as inheritance unto those whom We elected of Our bondmen. But of them are some who wrong themselves and of them are some who are lukewarm, and of them are some who outstrip (others) through good deeds, by Allah’s leave. That is the great favour!",Then We gave the Book the Qur’ān to those of Our servants whom We chose namely your community. Yet some of them are those who wrong themselves by failing to act fully in accordance with it and some of them are moderate acting in accordance with it most of the time and some are those who take the lead in performing good works so that in addition to his acquiring knowledge he disseminates it and shows others the way to proper conduct as well as acting in accordance with the Qur’ān by the leave of God by His will. That bequest to them of the Book is the greatest favour!
The Angels,35,33,Gardens of Eden! They enter them wearing armlets of gold and pearl and their raiment therein is silk.,Gardens of Eden as a permanent residence into which they will be admitted the three types of servants mentioned read active yadkhulūnahā ‘they will enter it’ or passive yudkhalūnahā ‘into which they will be admitted’ as the predicate of the subject jannāt ‘gardens’ — therein they will be adorned yuhallawna is a second predicate with some bracelets of gold and pearls studded with gold and their garments therein will be of silk.

The Angels,35,36,"But as for those who disbelieve, for them is fire of hell; it taketh not complete effect upon them so that they can die, nor is its torment lightened for them. Thus We punish every ingrate.",And as for those who disbelieve there will be for them the fire of Hell they will neither be done away with through death so that they may die and find rest nor will any aspect of its chastisement be lightened for them not even for a single moment. In this way in the way that We requite these We requite every ingrate every disbeliever read yujzā kullu kafūrin ‘every ingrate is so requited’; or najzī kulla kafūrin ‘so We requite every ingrate’.
The Angels,35,37,"And they cry for help there, (saying): Our Lord! Release us; we will do right, not (the wrong) that we used to do. Did not We grant you a life long enough for him who reflected to reflect therein ? And the warner came unto you. Now taste (the flavour of your deeds), for evil-doers have no helper.",While therein they will be crying out calling for help in distress howling and saying ‘Our Lord! Bring us forth from it and we will act righteously other than how we used to act’. But it will be said to them ‘Did We not give you long life enough time in which to take heed for him who would take heed? And moreover the warner the Messenger came to you but you did not respond to his call so taste now this chastisement! For the evildoers the disbelievers have no helper’ to ward off from them the chastisement.
The Angels,35,38,Lo! Allah is the Knower of the Unseen of the heavens and the earth. Lo! He is Aware of the secret of (men’s) breasts.,Truly God is Knower of the Unseen of the heavens and the earth; truly He knows well what is in the breasts what is in the hearts — thus there is all the more reason that He should also have knowledge of other things given the way people are.
The Angels,35,39,"He it is Who hath made you regents in the earth; so he who disbelieveth, his disbelief be on his own head. Their disbelief increaseth for the disbelievers, in their Lord’s sight, naught save abhorrence. Their disbelief increaseth for the disbelievers naught save loss.",It is He Who made you successors in the earth khalā’if ‘successors’ is the plural of khalīfa in other words one succeeding the other. So whoever disbelieves of you his disbelief will be to his own detriment that is the evil consequences of his disbelief will be so.

And their disbelief does not increase the disbelievers in anything except loss of the reward of the Hereafter.
The Angels,35,40,"Say: Have ye seen your partner-gods to whom ye pray beside Allah ? Show me what they created of the earth! Or have they any portion in the heavens ?

Or do they have some partnership some share alongside God in the creation of the heavens?’ Or have We given them a scripture so that they are acting upon a clear proof a definitive argument therefrom? to the effect that they have some partnership with Me? Nothing of the sort! Nay but the evildoers the disbelievers promise one another nothing but delusion falsehood when they say that the idols will intercede for them.
The Angels,35,41,"Lo! Allah graspeth the heavens and the earth that they deviate not, and if they were to deviate there is not one that could grasp them after Him. Lo! He is ever Clement, Forgiving.",Truly God sustains the heavens and the earth lest they disappear in other words He prevents them from disappearing. And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths they were to disappear there is none that can sustain them after Him in other words other than Him. Truly He is ever Forbearing Forgiving in deferring the punishment of the disbelievers.
The Angels,35,42,"And they swore by Allah, their most binding oath, that if a warner came unto them they would be more tractable than any of the nations; yet, when a warner came unto them it aroused in them naught save repugnance,",And they that is the disbelievers of Mecca swore by God their most solemn oaths they swore with utmost effort to be sincere in them that if a warner a messenger were to come to them they would be more readily guided than any one of the communities than the Jews the Christians or others in other words more readily guided than any one of these — having themselves seen the extent to which these groups called each other liars given that The Jews say ‘The Christians stand on nothing’ and the Christians say ‘The Jews stand on nothing’ Q. 2113. But when a warner namely Muhammad (s) did come to them this coming of his only increased them in aversion further away from right guidance
The Angels,35,43,"(Shown in their) behaving arrogantly in the land and plotting evil; and the evil plot encloseth but the men who make it. Then, can they expect aught save the treatment of the folk of old ? Thou wilt not find for Allah’s way of treatment any substitute, nor wilt thou find for Allah’s way of treatment aught of power to change.",acting with disdain in the land against faith istikbāran fī’l-ardi an object denoting reason and devising acts of evil in the way of idolatry and otherwise; and evil schemes will beset surround only their authors namely the one who devises such evil the qualifying of makr ‘scheme’ with the noun al-sayyi’ ‘evil’ is intrinsic to the fact that it is a scheme and so the annexation of the former to the latter is said to be alternative usage in which the annexed term is implied as a precaution against annexing a noun to an adjective. So do they expect do they await anything but the precedent of the ancients? God’s way of dealing with them such as chastising them for their denial of the messengers? Yet you will never find any change in God’s precedent and you will never find any revision in God’s precedent that is to say chastisement is never replaced by anything else nor is it ever meted out other than to the one who deserves it.
The Angels,35,44,"Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them, and they were mightier than these in power ? Allah is not such that aught in the heavens or in the earth escapeth Him. Lo! He is the Wise, the Mighty.",Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them — and they were mightier than these in power? but still God destroyed them for their denial of the messengers. And God is not such that anything in the heavens or in the earth can escape Him pre-empt Him or elude Him. Truly He is ever Knower of all things Omnipotent.
The Angels,35,45,"If Allah took mankind to task by that which they deserve, He would not leave a living creature on the surface of the earth; but He reprieveth them unto an appointed term, and when their term cometh - then verily (they will know that) Allah is ever Seer of His slaves.",Were God to take mankind to task for what they have acquired of acts of disobedience He would not leave on its surface that is the earth’s a single creature a single living thing moving thereon. But He reprieves them to an appointed term namely to the Day of Resurrection. And when their term comes — then truly they will know that God is ever Seer of His servants and so He will requite them according to the nature of their deeds rewarding the believers and punishing the disbelievers.

Yâ Sîn,36,9,"And We have set a bar before them and a bar behind them, and (thus) have covered them so that they see not.",And We have set before them a barrier read saddan or suddan in both instances and behind them a barrier; so We have covered them so they do not see — this is also figurative depicting the way in which the paths of faith are closed to them.

Yâ Sîn,36,11,Thou warnest only him who followeth the Reminder and feareth the Beneficent in secret. To him bear tidings of forgiveness and a rich reward.,You can only warn in other words your warning will only benefit him who follows the Remembrance the Qur’ān and fears the Compassionate One in secret who fears Him despite not having seen Him; so give him the good tidings of forgiveness and a noble reward namely Paradise.

And all things We have kept in a clear Register.",Truly it is We Who bring the dead to life for the resurrection and record in the Preserved Tablet what they have sent ahead during their lives of good or evil that they may be requited for it and their vestiges what conduct was followed after them as good practice. And everything kulla shay’in is in the accusative because of the verb that governs it and is the following We have numbered We have recorded precisely in a clear register a clear Book namely the Preserved Tablet.
Yâ Sîn,36,13,Coin for them a similitude: The people of the city when those sent (from Allah) came unto them;,And strike for them as a similitude mathalan is the first direct object the inhabitants ashāba is the second direct object of the town of Antioch Antākya when the messengers namely Jesus’s disciples came to it idh jā’ahā’l-mursalūna is an inclusive substitution for ashāba’l-qaryati ‘the inhabitants of the town’.
Yâ Sîn,36,14,"When We sent unto them twain, and they denied them both, so We reinforced them with a third, and they said: Lo! we have been sent unto you.",When We sent to them two men and they denied them both from idh arsalnā ilayhim ithnayni fa-kadhdhabūhumā to the end is a substitution for the previous idh ‘when’ so We reinforced them read fa-‘azaznā or fa-‘azzaznā in other words We reinforced the two men with a third and they said ‘We have indeed been sent to you by God’.
Yâ Sîn,36,15,They said: Ye are but mortals like unto us. The Beneficent hath naught revealed. Ye do but lie!,They said ‘You are nothing but humans like us and the Compassionate One has revealed nothing. You are only lying!’
Yâ Sîn,36,16,"They answered: Our Lord knoweth that we are indeed sent unto you,",They said ‘Our Lord knows qālū rabbunā ya‘lamu functions like an oath. Emphasis is intensified by this oath and also by the addition of the lām to what was before simply mursalūna ‘we have been sent’ to counter their intensified denial that we have indeed been sent to you by Him!
Yâ Sîn,36,17,And our duty is but plain conveyance (of the message).,And our duty is only to communicate in clear terms’ to deliver the Message clearly and manifestly with plain proofs such as the curing of the blind the leper and the diseased and the bringing of the dead back to life.
Yâ Sîn,36,18,"(The people of the city) said: We augur ill of you. If ye desist not, we shall surely stone you, and grievous torture will befall you at our hands.",They said ‘We augur ill of you for we have been deprived of rain because of you. If la-in the lām is for oaths you do not desist we will surely stone you and there shall befall you at our hands a painful chastisement’.

Nay, but ye are froward folk!",They said ‘May your augury of ill be with you! as punishment for your disbelief. What! Even if a-in the interrogative hamza has been added to the conditional in ‘if’ the hamza may be pronounced or elided but in both cases add an alif between it and the other one it be that you are being reminded? even if you are being admonished and made to fear God’s chastisement? the response to the conditional has been omitted that is to say ‘do you augur ill and disbelieve even if it be that you are being admonished?’ and this response constitutes the object of the interrogative which is meant rhetorically as a rebuke. Nay but you are a profligate people!’ who transgressing the bounds set by God with your practice of idolatry.
Yâ Sîn,36,20,And there came from the uttermost part of the city a man running. He cried: O my people! Follow those who have been sent!,And there came a man from the furthest part of the city — this was Habīb the carpenter who had believed in these messengers and whose house lay at the far end of the city — hastening with a hurried pace after he had heard that the people had denied the messengers. He said ‘O my people follow the messengers!
Yâ Sîn,36,21,"Follow those who ask of you no fee, and who are rightly guided.",Follow ittabi‘ū this reiterates the preceding ittabi‘ū them who do not ask you for any reward in return for delivering to you the message and who are rightly guided. And so he was asked ‘Do you follow their religion?’ So he replied
Yâ Sîn,36,22,"For what cause should I not serve Him Who hath created me, and unto Whom ye will be brought back ?",And why should I not worship Him Who originated me Him Who created me — in other words there is nothing to prevent me from worshipping Him when the necessitating factors for this exist and the same applies to you — and to Whom you shall be returned? after death whereupon He will requite you for your disbelief.

Yâ Sîn,36,28,"We sent not down against his people after him a host from heaven, nor do We ever send.",And We did not send mā here is for negation down on his people namely Habīb’s after him after his death any host from the heaven that is any angels to destroy them nor do We ever send down any angels to destroy anyone.

Yâ Sîn,36,30,"Ah, the anguish for the bondmen! Never came there unto them a messenger but they did mock him!",Ah the anguish for servants such as these and their like from among those who denied the messengers and were destroyed this word hasra denotes ‘extreme agony’; the vocative here is being used metaphorically in other words ‘It is time for you O anguish so come now!’. Never did a messenger come to them but that they mocked him this statement is given as an explanation of the cause thereof of the ‘agony’ since it the statement entails their mockery which itself results in their being destroyed and which in turn is the cause of the ‘anguish’.
Yâ Sîn,36,31,"Have they not seen how many generations We destroyed before them, which indeed returned not unto them;",Have they — that is those inhabitants of Mecca who said to the Prophet ‘You have not been sent by God!’ Q. 1343 — not seen not come to know the interrogative is meant rhetorically as an affirmative how many kam here is predicative as opposed to interrogative in other words it is to be understood as kathīran ‘many’; it is operated by the statement that comes next below and it comments on the operative clause for the statement that preceded it; the meaning then is as follows indeed many generations communities We have destroyed before them how that they the ones destroyed never return? to those deniers who are now alive? So will they not learn from their example? from annahum ‘how that they’ to the end of the verse is a substitution for the preceding clause kam ahlaknā qablahum mina’l-qurūni bearing in mind the aforementioned general meaning.
Yâ Sîn,36,32,"But all, without exception, will be brought before Us.",And indeed in is either for negation or is in its softened form every one of them that is every single creature kullun is the subject will be gathered jamī‘un is the predicate of the subject before Us at the Scene following their resurrection arraigned muhdarūna is a second predicate for the Reckoning read lammā with the sense of illā or lamā with the lām functioning as a separator and the mā being extra.
Yâ Sîn,36,33,"A token unto them is the dead earth. We revive it, and We bring forth from it grain so that they eat thereof;",And a sign for them of the truth of resurrection wa-āyatun lahum is a preceding predicate is the dead earth read maytatu or mayyitatu which We revive with water ahyaynāhā is the subject and out of which We bring forth grain such as wheat so that they eat thereof;
Yâ Sîn,36,34,"And We have placed therein gardens of the date-palm and grapes, and We have caused springs of water to gush forth therein,",and We have placed therein gardens orchards of date-palms and vines and We have caused a number of springs to gush forth therein
Yâ Sîn,36,35,"That they may eat of the fruit thereof, and their hands made it not. Will they not, then, give thanks ?",that they might eat of its fruits read thamarihi or thumurihi in other words of the fruits of the mentioned date-palms and otherwise; but it was not their hands that made it namely they did not cultivate the fruits. Will they not then give thanks? for His favours to them exalted be He?
Yâ Sîn,36,36,"Glory be to Him Who created all the sexual pairs, of that which the earth groweth, and of themselves, and of that which they know not!",Glory be to Him Who created all the pairs the specimens of what the earth produces of seeds and other things and of themselves of males and females and of what they do not know of marvellous and strange creatures.
Yâ Sîn,36,37,"A token unto them is night. We strip it of the day, and lo! they are in darkness.",And a sign for them of the tremendous power of God is the night from which We strip We separate the day and behold they find themselves in darkness passing into the darkness of the night.
Yâ Sîn,36,38,"And the sun runneth on unto a resting-place for him. That is the measuring of the Mighty, the Wise.",And the sun which runs from wa’l-shamsu tajrī to the end of the statement is subsumed by the introductory wa-āyatun lahum ‘and a sign for them’; alternatively it constitutes another sign for them; similar is the case with wa’l-qamara ‘and the moon’ further below to its resting-place in other words it does not overstep it. That namely its running is the ordaining of the Mighty in His kingdom the Knower of His creation.
Yâ Sîn,36,39,And for the moon We have appointed mansions till she return like an old shrivelled palm-leaf.,And the moon — read wa’l-qamaru in the nominative or wa’l-qamara in the accusative; and it may be in the accusative because of a following verb that governs it We have determined it with respect to its course to run in phases — twenty eight phases in twenty eight nights of every month; it becomes concealed for two nights when the month has thirty days and for one night when it has twenty nine days — until it returns during its final phase seeming to the human eye like an aged palm-bough in other words like the stalk with a date cluster when it ages becoming delicate arched and yellowish.
Yâ Sîn,36,40,"It is not for the sun to overtake the moon, nor doth the night outstrip the day. They float each in an orbit.",It does not behove — it is neither facilitated nor is it right for — the sun to catch up with the moon and so appear together with it at night nor may the night outrun the day and thus it the night never arrives before the latter ends and each kullun the nunation compensates for the missing genitive annexation that would have been constructed with al-shams ‘the sun’ al-qamar ‘the moon’ and al-nujūm ‘the stars’ of these is in an orbit swimming moving — these celestial bodies are being treated as though they were rational beings.
Yâ Sîn,36,41,"And a token unto them is that We bear their offspring in the laden ship,",And a sign for them of Our power is that We carried their seed dhurriyatahum a variant reading has dhurriyyātihim that is to say their original ancestors in the laden Ark that is Noah’s fully-loaded ship

Nay, but they are in doubt concerning My reminder; nay but they have not yet tasted My doom.",Has the Remembrance the Qur’ān been revealed to him Muhammad (s) out of all of us’ when he is neither the elder nor the noblest among us? In other words it could not have been revealed to him read a-unzila pronouncing both hamzas or not pronouncing the second one but in both cases inserting an intervening alif or without this insertion. God exalted be He says Nay but they are in doubt concerning My Remembrance My revelation that is the Qur’ān for they deny the one who has brought it.

How they climbed the wall into the royal chamber;,And has there come to you O Muhammad (s) the purpose of the interrogative indicated by hal here is to provoke curiosity and a desire to listen to what will follow the tale of the disputants when they scaled the sanctuary? David’s sanctuary that is his place of prayer for they had been prohibited from entering by the front gates because of his being engaged in worship in other words has it come to you their tale and their account?
Sâd,38,22,"How they burst in upon David, and he was afraid of them. They said: Be not afraid! (We are) two litigants, one of whom hath wronged the other, therefor judge aright between us; be not unjust; and show us the fair way.",When they entered upon David and he was frightened by them. And they said ‘Do not fear; we are two disputants some say that this means ‘two groups’ in order to agree with the plural person of the verb dakhalū ‘they entered’; others say ‘two individuals’ with the plural person actually denoting these two; al-khasm may refer to a one or more individuals. These two were angels who had come in the form of two disputants between whom there was supposed to have occurred the situation mentioned — but only hypothetically — in order to alert David peace be upon him to what he had done he had ninety nine women but desired the woman of a man who had only her and no other. He David had married her and consummated the marriage. One of us has infringed upon the rights of the other so judge justly between us and do not transgress do not be unjust and guide us direct us to the right path’ the correct way.

And David guessed that We had tried him, and he sought forgiveness of his Lord, and he bowed himself and fell down prostrate and repented.",He said ‘He has certainly wronged you by asking for your ewe that he may add it to his sheep. And indeed many associates infringe upon the rights of one another except such as believe and perform righteous deeds but few are they!’ mā emphasises the ‘fewness’. As the two angels were ascending to the heaven one said to the other ‘He has certainly passed judgement on himself!’ David was thus alerted to his deed. God exalted be He says And David thought in other words he became certain that We had indeed tried him that We had caused him to fall into a trial that is a test through his love for that woman. So he sought forgiveness of his Lord and fell down bowing in other words prostrate and repented.
Sâd,38,25,So We forgave him that; and lo! he had access to Our presence and a happy journey’s end.,So We forgave him that and indeed he has a station of nearness with Us that is even more good things in this world and a fair return in the Hereafter.

We have indeed made you a vicegerent on the earth managing the affairs of people; so judge justly between people and do not follow desire that is the desires of the soul that it then lead you astray from the way of God that is to say from the proofs that indicate the truth of His Oneness. Truly those who go astray from the way of God in other words from belief in God — for them there will be a severe chastisement because of their forgetting the Day of Reckoning’ as a result of their having neglected faith. For had they been certain of the truth of the Day of Reckoning they would have first been believers in this world.

One thousand horses were displayed before him after he had performed the midday prayer for he had wanted to use them in a holy struggle jihād against an enemy. But when the display reached the nine-hundredth horse the sun set and he had not performed the afternoon prayer. So he was greatly distressed.

On one occasion needing to withdraw to relieve himself he took it off and left it with this woman of his whose name was al-Amīna as was his custom; but a jinn disguised in the form of Solomon came to her and seized it from her. And We cast upon his throne a lifeless body which was that very jinn and he was the one known as Sakhr — or it was some other jinn; he sat upon Solomon’s throne and so as was the case with Solomon the birds and other creatures devoted themselves to him in service. When Solomon came out of his palace having seen him the jinn upon his throne he said to the people ‘I am Solomon not him!’ But they did not recognise him. Then he repented — Solomon returned to his kingdom many days later after he had managed to acquire the ring. He wore it and sat upon his throne again.

The Troops,39,3,"Surely pure religion is for Allah only. And those who choose protecting friends beside Him (say): We worship them only that they may bring us near unto Allah. Lo! Allah will judge between them concerning that wherein they differ. Lo! Allah guideth not him who is a liar, an ingrate.",Surely to God belongs pure religion none other than Him being deserving of it. And those who take besides Him the idols as patrons and they are the disbelievers of Mecca — they say ‘We only worship them so that they may bring us near to God’ zulfā a verbal noun with the sense of taqrīban ‘for the sake of nearness’. God will indeed judge between them and the Muslims concerning that about which they differ of religion and so admit the believers into Paradise and the disbelievers into the Fire. Truly God does not guide one who is a liar attributing a child to Him a disbeliever worshipping other than God.
The Troops,39,4,"If Allah had willed to choose a son, He could have chosen what He would of that which He hath created. Be He Glorified! He is Allah, the One, the Absolute.",Had God wanted to take a son — as they allege that He has ‘The Compassionate One has taken to Himself a son’ Q. 1988 He could have chosen from what He has created whatever He willed and taken it as a child instead of the angels whom they claim to be God’s daughters or their claim that ‘Ezra is the son of God’ or that ‘Jesus is the son of God’ cf. Q. 930. Glory be to Him in exaltation of Him as being above that He should take a child. He is God the One the All-Compelling over all His creatures.
The Troops,39,5,"He hath created the heavens and the earth with truth. He maketh night to succeed day, and He maketh day to succeed night, and He constraineth the sun and the moon to give service, each running on for an appointed term. Is not He the Mighty, the Forgiver ?",He created the heavens and the earth with the truth bi’l-haqqi is semantically connected to khalaqa ‘He created’. He turns the night into day so that it grows and turns the day into night so that it grows and He has disposed the sun and the moon each running in its course for an appointed term until the Day of Resurrection. Verily it is He Who is the Mighty Whose way always prevails Requiter of His enemies the ever Forgiving of His friends.
The Troops,39,6,"He created you from one being, then from that (being) He made its mate; and He hath provided for you of cattle eight kinds. He created you in the wombs of your mothers, creation after creation, in a threefold gloom. Such is Allah, your Lord. His is the Sovereignty. There is no God save Him. How then are ye turned away ?",He created you from a single soul namely Adam then made from it its mate Eve; and He sent down for you of the cattle of camels cows small cattle sheep and goats eight kinds of each kind a male and a female — as He makes clear in sūrat al-An‘ām Q. 6143f.. He creates you in your mothers’ wombs creation after creation that is to say as a sperm-drop then a blood clot then a foetus in a threefold darkness that is the darkness of the belly that of the womb and that of the placenta. That is God your Lord. To Him belongs all sovereignty. There is no god except Him. Why then are you being turned away? from worshipping Him to worshipping things other than Him?
The Troops,39,7,"If ye are thankless, yet Allah is Independent of you, though He is not pleased with thanklessness for His bondmen; and if ye are thankful He is pleased therewith for you. No laden soul will bear another’s load. Then unto your Lord is your return; and He will tell you what ye used to do. Lo! He knoweth what is in the breasts (of men).",If you are ungrateful indeed God is Independent of you though He does not approve of ingratitude for His servants even if He should will it to manifest itself in some of them. And if you give thanks to God and thus become believers He will approve of it read yardah or yardahu either lengthening the vowel or not that is of such thankfulness for you. And no burdened soul shall bear the burden of another soul in other words it will not bear the responsibility for it. Then to your Lord will be your return whereat He will inform you of what you used to do. Indeed He is Knower of what is in the breasts of what is in the hearts of men.
The Troops,39,8,"And when some hurt toucheth man, he crieth unto his Lord, turning unto Him (repentant). Then, when He granteth him a boon from Him he forgetteth that for which he cried unto Him before, and setteth up rivals to Allah that he may beguile (men) from his way. Say (O Muhammad, unto such an one): Take pleasure in thy disbelief a while. Lo! thou art of the owners of the Fire.",And when distress befalls a person that is the disbeliever he supplicates his Lord he implores turning returning to Him penitently. Then when He bestows on him a grace from Himself he forgets he neglects Him Whom he had supplicated implored before namely God in other words mā functions as min ‘whom’ and sets up equals associates with God that he may lead others astray read li-yadilla or li-yudilla from His way — from the religion of Islam. Say ‘Revel in your ingratitude for a while — for the remainder of your term of life. You shall indeed be among the inhabitants of the Fire’.
The Troops,39,9,"Is he who payeth adoration in the watches of the night, prostrate and standing, bewaring of the Hereafter and hoping for the mercy of his Lord, (to be accounted equal with a disbeliever) ? Say (unto them, O Muhammad): Are those who know equal with those who know not ? But only men of understanding will pay heed.",Or is he who read softened a-man devotes himself in worship observing duties of obedience in the watches of the night during its hours prostrating and standing in prayer apprehensive of the eventuality of the Hereafter in other words fearing its chastisement and hoping for the mercy the Paradise of his Lord … ? like one who is disobedient through disbelief or otherwise? a variant reading has am-man pronouncing the hamza so that am has the sense of bal ‘rather’. Say ‘Are those who know equal with those who do not know?’ in other words they are not equal just as the person of knowledge is not equal to the ignorant one. Only people of pith possessors of intellect remember only they are admonished.
The Troops,39,10,"Say: O My bondmen who believe! Observe your duty to your Lord. For those who do good in this world there is good, and Allah’s earth is spacious. Verily the steadfast will be paid their wages without stint.",Say ‘O servants of Mine who believe! Fear your Lord that is to say fear His chastisement by being obedient to Him. For those who are virtuous in this world through obedience there will be good and that is Paradise and God’s earth is vast so emigrate throughout it away from the company of disbelievers and the sight of indecencies. Truly the steadfast in their obedience of God and in enduring whatever hardship they may be tested with will be paid their reward in full without any reckoning’ without any measure or any scales to work it out.
The Troops,39,11,"Say (O Muhammad): Lo! I am commanded to worship Allah, making religion pure for Him (only).",Say ‘Indeed I have been commanded to worship God devoting my religion purely to Him pure of any idolatry
The Troops,39,12,And I am commanded to be the first of those who are muslims (surrender unto Him).,and I have been commanded to be the first of those who submit’ from this community.

The Troops,39,14,"Say: Allah I worship, making my religion pure for Him (only).",Say ‘God alone I worship devoting my religion purely to Him pure of any idolatry.
The Troops,39,15,"Then worship what ye will beside Him. Say: The losers will be those who lose themselves and their housefolk on the Day of Resurrection. Ah, that will be the manifest loss!",So worship whatever you wish besides Him’ other than Him — herein is a threat for them as well as a declaration of the fact that they do not worship God exalted be He. Say ‘Indeed the losers are those who will have lost their souls and their families on the Day of Resurrection by condemning their souls to abide forever in the Fire and their failure to attaining the bliss promised among the black-eyed virgins who would have been prepared for them in Paradise had they been believers. Truly that is the manifest loss!’
The Troops,39,16,"They have an awning of fire above them and beneath them a dais (of fire). With this doth Allah appal His bondmen. O My bondmen, therefor fear Me!",Above them they will have canopies layers of fire and beneath them they will have similar canopies of fire. That is what God frightens His servants with that is the believing ones that they may have fear of Him — this sense of the verse is suggested by what follows “So O servants of Mine fear Me!”’
The Troops,39,17,"And those who put away false gods lest they should worship them and turn to Allah in repentance, for them there are glad tidings. Therefor give good tidings (O Muhammad) to My bondmen",As for those who steer clear of the worship of false deities graven images and turn penitently apply themselves to God there are good tidings for them of Paradise. So give such good tidings to My servants
The Troops,39,18,"Who hear advice and follow the best thereof. Such are those whom Allah guideth, and such are men of understanding.",who listen to the words of God and follow the best sense of it which is that which contains the means to righteousness for them. Those they are the ones whom God has guided; and those they are the people of pith the possessors of intellect.
The Troops,39,19,"Is he on whom the word of doom is fulfilled (to be helped), and canst thou (O Muhammad) rescue him who is in the Fire ?",Can he against whom the word of chastisement has been fulfilled …? namely the words I will surely fill Hell with jinn and mankind together Q. 11119; Will you deliver bring out one who is in the Fire? this is the response to the conditional clause in which the overt qualification man fī’l-nār ‘one who is in the Fire’ replaces the pronominalisation a-fa-man ‘he … whom’; the hamza in a-fa-anta ‘will you’ is for rejection in other words the sense is that you will not be able to guide him and therefore deliver him from the Fire.
The Troops,39,20,"But those who keep their duty to their Lord, for them are lofty halls with lofty halls above them, built (for them), beneath which rivers flow. (It is) a promise of Allah. Allah faileth not His promise.",But as for those who fear their Lord and therefore obey Him — for them there will be lofty abodes with other lofty abodes built above them with rivers flowing beneath them that is beneath both the upper and the lower abodes — a promise of God wa‘da’Llāhi in the accusative because of an implied verb governing it. God does not fail the tryst He does not break His promise.
The Troops,39,21,"Hast thou not seen how Allah hath sent down water from the sky and hath caused it to penetrate the earth as watersprings, and afterward thereby produceth crops of divers hues; and afterward they wither and thou seest them turn yellow; then He maketh them chaff. Lo! herein verily is a reminder for men of understanding.",Have you not seen realised that God sends down water from the heaven then conducts it as springs making it enter points of springs in the ground? Then with it He brings forth crops of diverse hues. Then they wither they become dried-out and you see them for example after having been green turning yellow. Then He turns them into chaff. Truly in that there is a reminder for people of pith possessors of intellect by which they may be reminded for it is an indication of God’s Oneness and His power.
The Troops,39,22,"Is he whose bosom Allah hath expanded for Al-Islam, so that he followeth a light from his Lord, (as he who disbelieveth) ? Then woe unto those whose hearts are hardened against remembrance of Allah. Such are in plain error.",Is he whose breast God has opened to Islam and becomes guided so that he follows a light from his Lord …? like he whose heart He has sealed with disbelief? — this understanding of the ellipsis is indicated by what follows. So woe — an expression indicating ‘chastisement’ — to those whose hearts have been hardened against the remembrance of God that is hardened against the acceptance of the Qur’ān. Such are in manifest error.
The Troops,39,23,"Allah hath (now) revealed the fairest of statements, a Scripture consistent, (wherein promises of reward are) paired (with threats of punishment), whereat doth creep the flesh of those who fear their Lord, so that their flesh and their hearts soften to Allah’s reminder. Such is Allah’s guidance, wherewith He guideth whom He will. And him whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no guide.",God has revealed the best of discourses a Book kitāban substitutes for ahsana ‘the best’ namely a Qur’ān consimilar in other words some of its parts are similar to others in terms of their arrangement and otherwise in coupled phrases — a Book in which the Promise of reward is coupled with the Threat of punishment together with other such couplings — whereat quiver at the mention of whose Threat shiver the skins of those who fear their Lord; then their skins and their hearts soften to they are reassured by the remembrance of God that is at the mention of His Promise. That Book is God’s guidance by which He guides whomever He will of His servants; and whomever God leads astray for him there is no guide.
The Troops,39,24,"Is he then, who will strike his face against the awful doom upon the Day of Resurrection (as he who doeth right) ? And it will be said unto the wrong-doers: Taste what ye used to earn.",Is he who will be fending off is he who will encounter with his face the awful chastisement on the Day of Resurrection …? that is the most severe chastisement when he is flung into the Fire with his hands bound to his neck in fetters is he like one who will be secure from it by entering Paradise? And it will be said to the wrongdoers namely the disbelievers of Mecca ‘Taste now what you used to earn’ that is taste the requital for it.
The Troops,39,25,"Those before them denied, and so the doom came on them whence they knew not.",Those who were before them denied their messengers with regard to the coming of the chastisement; and so the chastisement came on them whence they were not aware in a way that would never have occurred to them.
The Troops,39,26,"Thus Allah made them taste humiliation in the life of the world, and verily the doom of the Hereafter will be greater if they did but know.",So God made them taste disgrace abasement and humiliation in the way of being transformed into swine and being killed and otherwise in the life of this world. And the chastisement of the Hereafter will surely be greater had they that is the deniers known the nature of the chastisement thereof they would not have denied.
The Troops,39,27,"And verily We have coined for mankind in this Qur’an all kinds of similitudes, that haply they may reflect;",And verily We have struck coined for mankind in this Qur’ān every kind of similitude that perhaps they may remember that perhaps they may be admonished —

Praise be to Allah! But most of them know not.",God strikes for the idolater and the believer in God’s Oneness a similitude a man rajulan substitutes for mathalan ‘a similitude’ shared by several masters quarrelling disputing ill-mannered and a man belonging exclusively to one man. Are the two equal in comparison? mathalan for specification in other words the slave of many masters is not the same as the slave of a single person. For in the case of the former if all of his masters were to demand his service simultaneously he would be confused as to whom of them he should serve — which is the similitude of the idolater; the latter the slave of one is the similitude of the one who believes in the One God. Praise be to God! alone. Nay but most of them that is the people of Mecca do not know the chastisement in which they will end up and so they associate others with God.
The Troops,39,30,"Lo! thou wilt die, and lo! they will die;",You — an address to the Prophet s — will indeed die and they too will indeed die and so there is no satisfaction to be gained from another’s death this was revealed because they kept waiting for the Prophet s to die.
The Troops,39,31,"Then lo! on the Day of Resurrection, before your Lord ye will dispute.",Then you will indeed O mankind concerning the injustices you committed towards one another be contending before your Lord on the Day of Resurrection.
The Troops,39,32,"And who doth greater wrong than he who telleth a lie against Allah, and denieth the truth when it reacheth him ? Will not the home of disbelievers be in hell ?",So who is — in other words none is — a greater wrongdoer than he who imputes falsehood to God by ascribing partners and child to Him and who denies the truth namely the Qur’ān when it reaches him? Is there not a fitting abode in Hell for the disbelievers? Indeed there is.
The Troops,39,33,And whoso bringeth the truth and believeth therein - Such are the dutiful.,And he who brings the truth — and that is the Prophet s — and those who confirm it namely the believers here alladhī ‘he who’ has the significance of alladhīna ‘those who’ those they are the ones who guard themselves against idolatry.

The Troops,39,36,"Will not Allah defend His slave ? Yet they would frighten thee with those beside Him. He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no guide.",Does God not suffice as defender of His servant? the Prophet? Indeed He does. Yet they would frighten you — the address is for him s — of those besides Him namely the idols by telling him that these idols might kill him or render him insane. And whomever God leads astray for him there is no guide.
The Troops,39,37,"And he whom Allah guideth, for him there can be no misleader. Is not Allah Mighty, Able to Requite (the wrong) ?",But whomever God guides there is no one able to lead him astray. Is not God Mighty One Whose way always prevails a Lord of Retribution? against His enemies? Indeed He is.
The Troops,39,38,"And verily, if thou shouldst ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth ? they will say: Allah.

Say: Allah is my all. In Him do (all) the trusting put their trust.",And if wa-la-in the lām is for oaths you ask them ‘Who created the heavens and the earth?’ they will surely say ‘God.’ Say ‘Have you considered then those on whom you call those whom you worship besides God namely the idols if God should desire some harm to befall me would they be able to remove the harm imposed by Him? No! Or if He should desire some mercy for me would they be able to withhold His mercy?’ No! a variant reading for the two clauses kāshifātun durrahu and mumsikātun rahmatahu has the genitive construction kāshifātu durrihi and mumsikātu rahmatihi. Say ‘God is sufficient for me. In Him do all the trusting put their trust’.

Indeed God then disgraced them at Badr.
The Troops,39,41,"Lo! We have revealed unto thee (Muhammad) the Scripture for mankind with truth. Then whosoever goeth right it is for his soul, and whosoever strayeth, strayeth only to its hurt. And thou art not a warder over them.",Truly We have revealed the Book to you for the sake of mankind with the truth bi’l-haqqi is semantically connected to anzalnā ‘We have revealed’. So whoever is guided then it his being guided is for the sake of his own soul and whoever goes astray goes astray only to the detriment thereof. And you are not meant to be a guardian over them and so compel them to embrace guidance.
The Troops,39,42,"Allah receiveth (men’s) souls at the time of their death, and that (soul) which dieth not (yet) in its sleep.

Then He retains those for whom He has ordained death and releases the others until an appointed term that is until the time of their death. The one that is released is the soul that possesses the faculty of discernment without which the soul containing the force of life is able to remain temporarily — but this cannot be the other way round. Truly in that mentioned there are signs indications for a people who reflect and then realise that the One with the power to do this also has the power to resurrect — Quraysh however never reflected on this fact.
The Troops,39,43,Or choose they intercessors other than Allah ? Say: What! Even though they have power over nothing and have no intelligence ?,Or have they — nay but they have — taken besides God idols as gods to act as intercessors? with God as they are wont to allege. Say to them ‘What! will they intercede even though they have no power whatever of intercession or otherwise and are unable to comprehend?’ that you worship them or to comprehend anything else for that matter?

The Troops,39,46,Say: O Allah! Creator of the heavens and the earth! Knower of the Invisible and the Visible! Thou wilt judge between Thy slaves concerning that wherein they used to differ.,Say ‘O God! Allāhumma means yā Allāh Originator of the heavens and the earth! the Creator of them without precedent Knower of the Unseen and the visible Knower of what is hidden and what is witnessed You will judge between Your servants concerning that wherein they used to differ’ in the matter of religion guide me to the truth over which they are at variance.

And there will appear there will become manifest to them from God that which they had never reckoned what they never supposed they would see.
The Troops,39,48,"And the evils that they earned will appear unto them, and that whereat they used to scoff will surround them.",And there will appear to them the evils of what they had earned and they will be besieged by there will descend on them that which they used to deride in other words the chastisement.
The Troops,39,49,"Now when hurt toucheth a man he crieth unto Us, and afterward when We have granted him a boon from Us, he saith: Only by force of knowledge I obtained it. Nay, but it is a test. But most of them know not.",So when some distress befalls man al-insān here a generic he supplicates Us. Then when We bestow on him a grace from Us he says ‘I was given it merely by force of knowledge’ from God that I was deserving of it. Nay but it this saying is a trial a test by which servants are tested. But most of them do not know that such bestowal of grace is a way of drawing them on and a test of their faith.
The Troops,39,50,"Those before them said it, yet (all) that they had earned availed them not;",Already the same was said by those who were before them of communities such as Korah and those of his people who were content with such a saying. But what they used to earn did not avail them.
The Troops,39,51,"But the evils that they earned smote them; and such of these as do wrong, the evils that they earn will smite them; they cannot escape.",So the evils of what they earned smote them that is the requital thereof smote them. And the evildoers among these namely among Quraysh shall also be smitten by the evils of what they earned and they will not be able to thwart it they will not elude Our chastisement — thus they were made to suffer seven years of drought and only afterwards were they enriched with provision from God.
The Troops,39,52,"Know they not that Allah enlargeth providence for whom He will, and straiteneth it (for whom He will). Lo! herein verily are portents for people who believe.",Do they not know that God extends His provision that He makes it abundant for whomever He will as a test and restricts it? for whomever He will as a trial? Truly in that there are signs for a people who believe in Him.
The Troops,39,53,"Say: O My slaves who have been prodigal to their own hurt! Despair not of the mercy of Allah, Who forgiveth all sins. Lo! He is the Forgiving, the Merciful.",Say that God declares ‘O My servants who have been prodigal against their own souls do not despair read taqnitū taqnatū or taqnutū do not give up hope of God’s mercy. Truly God forgives all sins for those who repent from idolatry. Truly He is the Forgiving the Merciful.
The Troops,39,54,"Turn unto your Lord repentant, and surrender unto Him, before there come unto you the doom, when ye cannot be helped.",And turn return penitently to your Lord and submit perform deeds sincerely to Him before the chastisement comes on you whereupon you will not be helped to ward it off if you have not repented.
The Troops,39,55,"And follow the better (guidance) of that which is revealed unto you from your Lord, before the doom cometh on you suddenly when ye know not,",And follow the best of what has been revealed to you from your Lord — namely the Qur’ān — before the chastisement comes on you suddenly while you are unaware’ of the time of its arrival until it has actually come;
The Troops,39,56,"Lest any soul should say: Alas, my grief that I was unmindful of Allah, and I was indeed among the scoffers!",so apply yourselves to this before any soul should say ‘Alas for me yā hasratā is actually yā hasratī meaning ‘O regret of mine’ for what I have neglected of my duty to God in other words of obedience to Him. Indeed wa-in in is softened in place of the hardened form in other words understand it as wa-innī I was among those who ridiculed’ His religion and His Book;
The Troops,39,57,Or should say: If Allah had but guided me I should have been among the dutiful!,or before that it should say ‘If only God had guided me to obedience and I had become guided I would have been among those who have feared’ His chastisement;
The Troops,39,58,"Or should say, when it seeth the doom: Oh, that I had but a second chance that I might be among the righteous!",or before that it should say when it sees the chastisement ‘If only there had been a second chance a return to this world I would be among the virtuous’ the believers. It is then said to him by God
The Troops,39,59,"(But now the answer will be): Nay, for My revelations came unto thee, but thou didst deny them and wast scornful and wast among the disbelievers.",‘Yes indeed! My signs came to you the Qur’ān — which is the means to guidance — but you denied them and were arrogant you disdained to believe in them and you were among the disbelievers’.

Is not the home of the scorners in hell ?,And on the Day of Resurrection you will see those who imputed lies to God by ascribing partner and child to Him with their faces blackened. Is there not in Hell a fitting abode for those who are too arrogant? to believe? Indeed there is.
The Troops,39,61,"And Allah delivereth those who ward off (evil) because of their deserts. Evil toucheth them not, nor do they grieve.",And God will deliver from Hell those who fear idolatry because of their triumph that is on account of the place they have won in Paradise by placing them in it. No evil will touch them nor will they grieve.
The Troops,39,62,"Allah is Creator of all things, and He is Guardian over all things.",God is the Creator of all things and He is Guardian over all things disposing of them as He will.
The Troops,39,63,"His are the keys of the heavens and the earth, and they who disbelieve the revelations of Allah - such are they who are the losers.",To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth in other words the keys to their storehouses of rain and vegetation and other things.

The Troops,39,64,"Say (O Muhammad, to the disbelievers): Do ye bid me serve other than Allah ? O ye fools!",Say ‘Is it something other than God that you bid me to worship O you who are ignorant?’ ghayra is in the accusative because of the verb a‘budu ‘I worship’ which itself is operated by ta’murūnī ‘you bid me’ read with one nūn on the basis of an implicit an; it ta’murūnī may also be read with two nūns assimilated ta’murūnnī or separated ta’murūnanī.

The Troops,39,66,"Nay, but Allah must thou serve, and be among the thankful!",Rather worship God alone and be among the thankful of His bestowal of graces on you.

But the word of doom of disbelievers is fulfilled.",And those who disbelieve will be driven violently to Hell in troops in separate groups until when they reach it its gates are opened futihat abwābuhā is the response to idhā ‘when’ and its keepers will say to them ‘Did there not come to you any messengers from among yourselves reciting to you the signs of your Lord the Qur’ān and otherwise and warning you of the encounter of this day of yours?’ They will say ‘Yes indeed; but the word of chastisement — namely the verse Assuredly I will fill Hell … Q. 11119 — against the disbelievers has been fulfilled’.
The Troops,39,72,It is said (unto them): Enter ye the gates of hell to dwell therein. Thus hapless is the journey’s end of the scorners.,It will be said ‘Enter the gates of Hell to abide therein’ — decreed for you to abide therein. For evil indeed is the abode of the arrogant!’

Ye are good, so enter ye (the Garden of delight), to dwell therein;",And those who feared their Lord will be driven gently to Paradise in troops until when they reach it and its gates are opened wa-futihat the wāw here indicates a circumstantial qualifier implying qad ‘already’ and its keepers will say to them ‘Peace be to you! You are good! tibtum a circumstantial qualifier So enter it to abide therein’ — enter it with the decree that you are to abide in it forever the response to idhā ‘when’ is implicit and is in other words dakhalūhā ‘they enter it’. The manner of their being driven as well as the opening of the gates before their arrival is a way of honouring them; the driving of the disbelievers however and the opening of the gates only upon their arrival so that all of its heat is retained for them is a means of humiliating them.
The Troops,39,74,"They say: Praise be to Allah, Who hath fulfilled His promise unto us and hath made us inherit the land, sojourning in the Garden where we will! So bounteous is the wage of workers.",And they will say this is a supplement to the implicit response dakhalūhā ‘they enter it’ ‘Praise be to God Who has fulfilled His promise to us of Paradise and has made us inherit the land the land of Paradise that we may settle in Paradise wherever we wish’ for it is all Paradise and there is no spot that can be preferred to another.

There is no god except Him; to Him is the journeying the ultimate return.
The Believer,40,4,"None argue concerning the revelations of Allah save those who disbelieve, so let not their turn of fortune in the land deceive thee (O Muhammad).",None dispute the signs of God — the Qur’ān — except those who disbelieve from among the people of Mecca so do not be deceived by their bustle in the towns going about seeking their livelihood in security for the sequel for them will be the Fire.

Is there any way to go out ?",They will say ‘Our Lord You have caused us to die twice two deaths and You have given us life twice — for they were lifeless drops of semen then they were given life then made to die then brought back to life for the Resurrection.

None payeth heed save him who turneth (unto Him) repentant.",He it is Who shows you His signs the proofs of His Oneness and sends down from the heaven for you provision by way of rain.

The evildoers will not have any intimate friend any sympathiser nor any intercessor who might be heeded — the adjectival qualification ‘who might be heeded’ has no literal significance for they do not have intercessors in the first place So now we have no intercessors … Q. 26100. The first part however may be said to have significance if understand on the basis of their claim to have intercessors and so in other words even if — hypothetically speaking — they their intercessors did intercede for them they would not be heeded.

If he is lying then his mendacity will be to his own detriment that is the harm resulting from his mendacity will be to his own detriment; but if he is truthful then there will befall you some of that with which he is threatening you in the way of chastisement soon.

Thus Allah deceiveth him who is a prodigal, a doubter.",And verily Joseph brought you before in other words before Moses — according to one opinion this Joseph is the son of Jacob having been given life until the time of Moses; according to another opinion this is Joseph son of Abraham son of Joseph son of Jacob — clear signs manifest miracles but you continued to be in doubt concerning what he had brought you until when he died you said without any evidence to support such a claim “God will never send any messenger after him” — in other words you will never cease to disbelieve in Joseph and others that may come after him.

So just as they have been led astray God sets a seal of misguidance on the heart of every arrogant tyrant read qalbin ‘the heart of’ with nunation or without qalbi. As the heart grows arrogant so does the individual and vice versa kulli in both readings is meant to indicate the totality of the misguidance of such hearts not the totality of the hearts.

Allah is Seer of (His) slaves.,For you will soon remember what I have said to you when you see the chastisement with your own eyes. And I entrust my affair to God. Truly God is Seer of His servants’ — he said this after they threatened him with retribution for opposing their religion.
The Believer,40,45,"So Allah warded off from him the evils which they plotted, while a dreadful doom encompassed Pharaoh’s folk,",So God shielded him from the evils of what they had plotted against him in the way of killing him and there besieged befell the folk of Pharaoh his people as well as him a dreadful chastisement drowning

He, only He, is the Hearer, the Seer.",Truly those who dispute the signs of God the Qur’ān without any warrant any evidence that has come to them — there is only vanity in their breasts only arrogance and an evil desire to get the better of you which they will never attain and satisfy. So seek refuge with God from their evil. Surely He is the Hearer of their sayings the Seer of their state.
The Believer,40,57,Assuredly the creation of the heavens and the earth is greater than the creation of mankind; but most of mankind know not.,The following was revealed regarding the deniers of resurrection Assuredly the creation of the heavens and the earth as an unprecedented first act is greater than the creation of mankind a second time — which is the restoration of them after death; but most people namely the disbelievers of Mecca do not know this and so they are like the blind whereas those who know it are like those who have sight.
The Believer,40,58,"And the blind man and the seer are not equal, neither are those who believe and do good works (equal with) the evil-doer. Little do ye reflect!",And the blind one and the seer are not equal; nor are they equal those who believe and perform righteous deeds — such a person being the virtuous one — and the evildoer wa-lā’l-musī’u lā here is extra. Little do they reflect little are they admonished read yatadhakkarūna or second person plural tatadhakkarūna ‘do you reflect’ in other words their reflections are very few.
The Believer,40,59,"Lo! the Hour is surely coming, there is no doubt thereof; yet most of mankind believe not.",Truly the Hour is coming; there is no doubt in it. But most people do not believe in it.
The Believer,40,60,"And your Lord hath said: Pray unto Me and I will hear your prayer. Lo! those who scorn My service, they will enter hell, disgraced.",And your Lord has said ‘Call on Me and I will respond to you in other words worship Me and I will reward you — judging this to be the meaning by what follows. Surely those who disdain to worship Me shall enter sa-yadkhulūna or passive sa-yudkhalūna ‘they shall be admitted into’ Hell utterly humiliated’ abased.
The Believer,40,61,"Allah it is Who hath appointed for you night that ye may rest therein, and day for seeing. Lo! Allah is a Lord of bounty for mankind, yet most of mankind give not thanks.",God it is Who made for you night that you may rest in it and day for seeing — the attribution of sight ibsār to ‘day’ is figurative and it is so attributed because one is able to see in it. Surely God is a Lord of bounty to mankind but most people are not thankful to God and so they do not believe.
The Believer,40,62,"Such is Allah, your Lord, the Creator of all things, There is no God save Him. How then are ye perverted ?",That then is God your Lord the Creator of all things; there is no god except Him. How then are you made to deviate? how then are you turned away from faith despite the evidence having been established for it?
The Believer,40,63,Thus are they perverted who deny the revelations of Allah.,So deviate that is in the same way that these Meccans deviate deviate those who used to deny the signs of God His miracles.
The Believer,40,64,"Allah it is Who appointed for you the earth for a dwelling-place and the sky for a canopy, and fashioned you and perfected your shapes, and hath provided you with good things. Such is Allah, your Lord. Then blessed be Allah, the Lord of the Worlds!",God it is Who made for you the earth as a stable abode and the heaven as a canopy a ceiling. And He formed you and perfected your forms and provided you with all the wholesome things. That then is God your Lord so blessed be God the Lord of the Worlds.
The Believer,40,65,"He is the Living One. There is no God save Him. So pray unto Him, making religion pure for Him (only). Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the Worlds!",He is the Living; there is no god except Him. So supplicate Him worship Him devoting your religion purely to Him free from any idolatry. Praise be to God the Lord of the Worlds.
The Believer,40,66,"Say (O Muhammad): I am forbidden to worship those unto whom ye cry beside Allah since there have come unto me clear proofs from my Lord, and I am commanded to surrender to the Lord of the Worlds.",Say ‘I have been forbidden to worship those on whom you call those whom you worship besides God since there have come to me clear signs proofs of His Oneness from my Lord; and I have been commanded to submit to the Lord of the Worlds’.
The Believer,40,67,"He it is Who created you from dust, then from a drop (of seed) then from a clot, then bringeth you forth as a child, then (ordaineth) that ye attain full strength and afterward that ye become old men - though some among you die before - and that ye reach an appointed term, that haply ye may understand.",He it is Who created you from dust by having created your father Adam from it then from a drop of sperm then from a blood-clot congealed blood then He brings you forth as infants then He sustains you that you may come of age until you have attained your full strength — this being from the age of thirty to forty — then that you may become aged read shuyūkhan or shiyūkhan— though there are some of you who die earlier that is before coming of age or becoming aged. He does this to you so that you may live on and that you may complete an appointed term a defined length of time that perhaps you might understand the proofs of His Oneness and thus become believers.
The Believer,40,68,"He it is Who quickeneth and giveth death. When He ordaineth a thing, He saith unto it only: Be! and it is.",He it is Who gives life and brings death. So when He decides upon a matter when He wants to bring something into existence He only says to it ‘Be!’ and it is read fa-yakūnu or fa-yakūna in the subjunctive on account of an implied preceding an. In other words it comes into existence after He has willed it that which is signified by the said words.
The Believer,40,69,"Hast thou not seen those who wrangle concerning the revelations of Allah, how they are turned away ? -",Have you not regarded those who dispute the signs of God the Qur’ān how they are turned away? from faith —
The Believer,40,70,"Those who deny the Scripture and that wherewith We send Our messengers. But they will come to know,",those who deny the Book the Qur’ān and that wherewith We have sent Our messengers in the way of the affirmation of God’s Oneness and belief in the Resurrection — and these deniers are the Meccan disbelievers. But they will come to know the punishment for their denials;
The Believer,40,71,When carcans are about their necks and chains. They are dragged,when idh has the meaning of idhā with fetters around their necks and chains wa’l-salāsilu a supplement to al-aghlālu ‘fetters’ so that the meaning is that these chains are also around their necks; or it al-salāsilu ‘chains’ is the subject the predicate of which has been omitted in other words the meaning being around their feet will be these chains — or alternatively its predicate is the following yushabūna they are dragged in other words they are dragged away by these chains.
The Believer,40,72,Through boiling waters; then they are thrust into the Fire.,into the boiling water that is into Hell then in the Fire they are set aflame.
The Believer,40,73,Then it is said unto them: Where are (all) that ye used to make partners (in the Sovereignty),Then it will be said to them in reproach ‘Where are those whom you used to make partners
The Believer,40,74,Beside Allah ? They say: They have failed us; but we used not to pray to anything before. Thus doth Allah send astray the disbelievers (in His guidance).,besides God?’ alongside Him and these are the idols. They will say ‘They have forsaken abandoned us and so we cannot see them. Nay but actually we were not invoking anything before’. They deny that they used to worship these idols; but then these idols are brought before them — which is where God exalted be He says ‘Truly you and what you worship besides God shall be fuel for Hell’ Q. 2198. So in the same way that these disbelievers have been led astray God leads astray the disbelievers.
The Believer,40,75,"(And it is said unto them): This is because ye exulted in the earth without right, and because ye were petulant.",And it will also be said to them ‘That chastisement is because you used to exult in the earth without right by your idolatry and denial of resurrection and because you were insolent committing acts of disobedience in abundance.
The Believer,40,76,"Enter ye the gates of hell, to dwell therein. Evil is the habitation of the scornful.",Enter the gates of Hell to abide therein’. Evil then is the ultimate abode of the arrogant!
The Believer,40,77,"Then have patience (O Muhammad). Lo! the promise of Allah is true. And whether we let thee see a part of that which We promise them, or (whether) We cause thee to die, still unto Us they will be brought back.",So be patient. Assuredly God’s promise to chastise them is true. And if We show you fa-immā contains an assimilated conditional particle in; the mā is extra and emphasises the conditional import at the beginning of the verb while the nūn emphasises it at the end a part of what We promise them of chastisement in your lifetime the response to the conditional has been omitted in other words it is something like ‘then so be it!’ … or We take you unto Us in death before their chastisement then in any case to Us they will be returned whereupon We shall chastise them with the most severe punishment this last mentioned response is that of the supplement only.
The Believer,40,78,"Verily We sent messengers before thee, among them those of whom We have told thee, and some of whom We have not told thee; and it was not given to any messenger that he should bring a portent save by Allah’s leave, but when Allah’s commandment cometh (the cause) is judged aright, and the followers of vanity will then be lost.",And verily We sent messengers before you. Of them are those whom We have recounted to you and of them are those whom We have not recounted to you it is reported that God exalted be He sent 8000 prophets 4000 prophets sent from among the Children of Israel and the other 4000 from among the remainder of mankind. And it was never permitted for any messenger from among them to bring a sign except with God’s permission for they are also servants enthralled by Him. Hence when God’s command comes for the chastisement to be sent down on the disbelievers judgement between the messengers and their deniers is passed justly; and it is thence that the advocates of falsehood become losers that is to say it is thence that the judgement and the loss become manifest for mankind although such advocates of falsehood will have always been losers always before that.
The Believer,40,79,"Allah it is Who hath appointed for you cattle, that ye may ride on some of them, and eat of some -",God it is Who made for you cattle — it is said that ‘camels’ are specifically meant here even though it seems to signify cows and sheep also — that you may ride some of them and eat of some.
The Believer,40,80,"(Many) benefits ye have from them - and that ye may satisfy by their means a need that is in your breasts, and may be borne upon them as upon the ship.",And there are other uses for you in them such as their milk offspring fur and wool and that by them you may satisfy any need that is in your breasts namely to transport heavy loads to other lands and on them on land and on the ships in the sea you are carried.
The Believer,40,81,"And He showeth you His tokens. Which, then, of the tokens of Allah do ye deny ?",And He shows you His signs. So which of God’s signs that is the signs that prove His Oneness do you reject? the interrogative here is meant as a rebuke; ayya ‘which of’ is more commonly made masculine than feminine.
The Believer,40,82,"Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those before them ? They were more numerous than these, and mightier in power and (in the) traces (which they left behind them) in the earth. But all that they used to earn availed them not.",Have they not travelled across the land to see the nature of the consequence for those before them? They were more powerful than them in might and in their vestiges on earth in the way of large structures and palaces. But what they used to earn did not avail them.
The Believer,40,83,And when their messengers brought them clear proofs (of Allah’s Sovereignty) they exulted in the knowledge they (themselves) possessed. And that which they were wont to mock befell them.,And when their messengers brought them clear signs manifest miracles they the disbelievers exulted in the knowledge they the messengers possessed an exultation that entailed mockery and amusement as they rejected such knowledge and there besieged befell them that which they used to deride namely the chastisement.
The Believer,40,84,"Then, when they saw Our doom, they said: We believe in Allah only and reject (all) that we used to associate (with Him).",Then when they saw Our doom that is the severity of Our chastisement they said ‘We believe in God alone and we disavow what we used to associate with Him’.
The Believer,40,85,But their faith could not avail them when they saw Our doom. This is Allah’s law which hath ever taken course for His bondmen. And then the disbelievers will be ruined.,But their faith was of no benefit to them when they saw Our doom — This is God’s way sunnata’Llāhi is in the accusative because it functions as a verbal noun from an implicit verb of the same expression with the believers among all communities which is that faith is of no benefit to them once the chastisement has been sent down which has its precdent; and it is thence that the disbelievers will be losers — it is thence that their status as losers will become apparent to all of mankind even though they will have always been losers before that.

A part of them will be in Paradise and a part will be in the Blaze the Fire.
Counsel,42,8,"Had Allah willed, He could have made them one community, but Allah bringeth whom He will into His mercy. And the wrong-doers have no friend nor helper.",And had God willed He would have made them one community in other words following one religion and that is Islam; but He admits whomever He will into His mercy and the evildoers the disbelievers have neither guardian nor helper to ward off the chastisement from them.

He quickeneth the dead, and He is Able to do all things.",Or have they taken idols as guardians besides Him? am ‘or’ is disjunctive functioning with the sense of bal ‘nay but’ the one used to denote a shift in the subject matter; the hamza is for denial in other words ‘those who are taken’ as guardians are not in fact guardians of anything. But God He alone is the Guardian in other words then One who helps believers the fā’ of fa’Llāhu is merely for coordination and He revives the dead and He has power over all things.

He is Knower of all things.,To Him belong the keys of the heavens and the earth the keys to their storehouses of rain and vegetation and other things. He extends provision He makes it abundant for whomever He will as a test of their gratitude and He restricts it He straitens it for whomever He will as a trial. Truly He has knowledge of all things.
Counsel,42,13,"He hath ordained for you that religion which He commended unto Noah, and that which We inspire in thee (Muhammad), and that which We commended unto Abraham and Moses and Jesus, saying: Establish the religion, and be not divided therein. Dreadful for the idolaters is that unto which thou callest them. Allah chooseth for Himself whom He will, and guideth unto Himself him who turneth (toward Him).",He has prescribed for you as a religion that which He enjoined upon Noah — for he was the first of the prophets sent with a Divine Law — and that which We have revealed to you and that which We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus declaring ‘Establish religion and do not be divided in it’ this is what has been prescribed and enjoined upon those mentioned above and what has been revealed to Muhammad (s) and it is the affirmation of God’s Oneness. Dreadful is for the idolaters that to which you summon them in the way of affirming the Oneness of God. God chooses for it for the task of affirming His Oneness whomever He will and He guides to it whomever turns penitently whomever applies himself to obedience of Him.
Counsel,42,14,"And they were not divided until after the knowledge came unto them, through rivalry among themselves; and had it not been for a Word that had already gone forth from thy Lord for an appointed term, it surely had been judged between them. And those who were made to inherit the Scripture after them are verily in hopeless doubt concerning it.",And they did not become divided that is the adherents of the monotheistic religions did not become divided in religion — so that some affirmed the Oneness of God while others rejected it — except after the knowledge of His Oneness had come to them out of jealous rivalry on the part of the disbelievers among themselves. And were it not for a Word that preceded from your Lord to defer requital of them until an appointed term until the Day of Resurrection it would have already been judged between them to chastise the disbelievers in this world. And indeed those who were made heirs to the Scripture after them namely the Jews and the Christians are truly in grave doubt concerning him Muhammad (s).
Counsel,42,15,"Unto this, then, summon (O Muhammad).

Our deeds concern us and your deeds concern you and so each one of us will be requited according to his own deeds. There is no argument no dispute between us and you — this was revealed before the command to struggle against them. God will bring us together at the time of the Return to decide definitively between us and to Him is the final destination’ the ultimate return.
Counsel,42,16,"And those who argue concerning Allah after He hath been acknowledged, their argument hath no weight with their Lord, and wrath is upon them and theirs will be an awful doom.",And those who argue with the Prophet concerning the religion of God after His call has been answered through faith on account of His miracle having been manifested — and they are the Jews — their argument stands refuted is invalid with their Lord and His wrath shall be upon them and there will be a severe chastisement for them.
Counsel,42,17,"Allah it is Who hath revealed the Scripture with truth, and the Balance. How canst thou know ? It may be that the Hour is nigh.",God it is Who has revealed the Book the Qur’ān with the truth bi’l-haqqi is semantically connected to anzala ‘revealed’ as well as the Balance Justice. And what do you know — perhaps the Hour that is its arrival is near! la‘alla ‘perhaps’ comments on the verb describing the action with what follows it functioning as two direct objects.

Are not they who dispute, in doubt concerning the Hour, far astray ?",Those who do not believe in it seek to hasten it they say ‘When will it come?’ as a presumption on their part that it will never come; but those who believe are apprehensive of it and know that it is the truth.

Lo! for wrong- doers is a painful doom.",Or have they the Meccan disbelievers associates — these being their devils — who have prescribed for them for the disbelievers a religion a corrupt religion which God has not given permission for? such as idolatry and denial of resurrection? And were it not for a prior decisive word in other words a prior decree to the effect that requital will take place on the Day of Resurrection it would have been judged between them and the believers by chastising the former in this world. Truly the wrongdoers the disbelievers will have a painful chastisement.
Counsel,42,22,"Thou seest the wrong-doers fearful of that which they have earned, and it will surely befall them, while those who believe and do good works (will be) in flowering meadows of the Gardens, having what they wish from their Lord. This is the great preferment.",You will see the wrongdoers on the Day of Resurrection apprehensive because of what they had earned in this world in the way of evil deeds lest they be requited for these; and it that is the requital for these deeds will surely befall them on the Day of Resurrection inevitably; but those who believe and perform righteous deeds will be in the lushest Gardens in other words in the best of these Gardens in comparison with the other ones. They will have whatever they wish near their Lord; that is the great favour.
Counsel,42,23,"This it is which Allah announceth unto His bondmen who believe and do good works. Say (O Muhammad, unto mankind): I ask of you no fee therefor, save lovingkindness among kinsfolk. And whoso scoreth a good deed We add unto its good for him. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Responsive.",That is the good tidings read yubshiru or yubashshiru from bishāra ‘good news’ which God gives to His servants who believe and perform righteous deeds. Say ‘I do not ask of you any reward for it for delivering the Message except the affection for my kinsfolk illā ‘except’ this represents a discontinuous exception in other words ‘but I do ask of you that you show affection for my kinship with you which at the same time is your kinship’; for he the Prophet had kinship ties with all the subdivisions of the tribe of Quraysh. And whoever acquires a good deed an act of obedience We shall enhance for him its goodness by multiplying the reward for it. Surely God is Forgiving of sins Appreciative even of little good and so He multiplies it manifold.
Counsel,42,24,"Or say they: He hath invented a lie concerning Allah ? If Allah willed, He could have sealed thy heart (against them). And Allah will wipe out the lie and will vindicate the truth by His words. Lo! He is Aware of what is hidden in the breasts (of men).",Or am here is like bal do they say ‘He has invented a lie against God?’ in ascribing the Qur’ān to God exalted be He. For if God will He can seal He can fortify your heart with patience to endure the hurt they cause you by such sayings and otherwise — and God did this. And God will efface the falsehood which they speak and vindicate confirm the truth with His words the ones revealed to His Prophet. Truly He is Knower of what is in the breasts of what is in the hearts of people.
Counsel,42,25,"And He it is Who accepteth repentance from His bondmen, and pardoneth the evil deeds, and knoweth what ye do,",And He it is Who accepts repentance from His servants and pardons evil deeds those from which repentance has been made and knows what they do yaf‘alūna may also be read taf‘alūna ‘you do’.
Counsel,42,26,"And accepteth those who do good works, and giveth increase unto them of His bounty. And as for disbelievers, theirs will be an awful doom.",And He answers those who believe and perform righteous deeds He grants them what they ask for and He enhances them of His bounty. And as for the disbelievers for them there will be a severe chastisement.
Counsel,42,27,"And if Allah were to enlarge the provision for His slaves they would surely rebel in the earth, but He sendeth down by measure as He willeth. Lo! He is Informed, a Seer of His bondmen.",For were God to extend His provision to His servants to all of them they would all of them surely become covetous in other words they would become tyrants in the earth; but He sends down read yunzilu or yunazzilu of provisions in the measure that He will thus extending it for some of His servants to the exclusion of others — and from such extending of provision to some emerges tyranny. Surely He is Aware Seer of His servants.

He is the Protecting Friend, the Praiseworthy.",And He it is Who sends down the saving rain after they have despaired after they have given up hope of its being sent down and unfolds His mercy He extends His rain and He is the true Patron the Benevolent towards believers the Praised by them.

Counsel,42,30,"Whatever of misfortune striketh you, it is what your right hands have earned. And He forgiveth much.",And whatever affliction whatever misfortune or hardship may befall you — this is an address to the believers — is on account of what your own hands have earned that is to say for the sins that you have committed — the use of ‘hands’ to express this is because most actions are effected by them. And He pardons much of these sins and does not requite them for God’s kindness is greater than that He should for example double the requital in the Hereafter; as for those who do not commit grave sins then what befalls them in this world of hardship raises their degree in the reward of the Hereafter.
Counsel,42,31,"Ye cannot escape in the earth, for beside Allah ye have no protecting friend nor any helper.",And you O idolaters cannot escape from God by fleeing on earth and thus elude Him and besides God that is to say other than Him you have neither protector nor helper to ward off His chastisement from you.
Counsel,42,32,"And of His portents are the ships, like banners on the sea;",And of His signs are the ships that run on the sea appearing like landmarks like mountains in terms of their magnitude.
Counsel,42,33,If He will He calmeth the wind so that they keep still upon its surface - Lo! herein verily are signs for every steadfast grateful (heart). -,If He will He stills the wind whereat they remain they become motionless fixed not moving on its surface. Surely in that there are signs for every steadfast grateful servant — this is the believer who is steadfast during hardship and grateful in times of comfort.
Counsel,42,34,Or He causeth them to perish on account of that which they have earned - And He forgiveth much -,Or He wrecks them yūbiqhunna a supplement to yuskin ‘He stills’ that is to say or He sinks them including their passengers by sending violent winds upon them because of what they that is the passengers of these ships have earned of sins. And He pardons much of such sin and does not cause those who have sinned to drown.
Counsel,42,35,And that those who argue concerning Our revelations may know they have no refuge.,And that those who dispute concerning Our signs may know read indicative wa-ya‘lamu ‘and they know’ beginning a new sentence; or subjunctive wa-ya‘lama ‘and that they may know’ as a supplement to an implicit reason in other words ‘He drowns them in order to exact vengeance against them and so that they may know that …’ they have no refuge no escape from the chastisement the negation represents two direct objects of the verb ya‘lamu or ya‘lama ‘they know’; the negation is also a comment on the implied action of ‘escaping’.
Counsel,42,36,"Now whatever ye have been given is but a passing comfort for the life of the world, and that which Allah hath is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord,",So whatever you — this is an address is to believers and others — have been given of the luxuries of this world is but the enjoyment of the life of this world enjoyed for the duration of it but then perishes. But what is with God of reward is better and more lasting for those who believe and put their trust in their Lord li’lladhīna āmanū wa-‘alā rabbihim yatawakkalūna is supplemented by the following clause
Counsel,42,37,"And those who shun the worst of sins and indecencies and, when they are wroth, forgive,",and those who avoid grave sins and indecencies those acts that require the implementing of the prescribed legal punishments hudūd the supplement above is an example of supplementing the part to the whole and who when they are angry forgive they let it pass;
Counsel,42,38,"And those who answer the call of their Lord and establish worship, and whose affairs are a matter of counsel, and who spend of what We have bestowed on them,",and those who answer their Lord those who respond to what He has summoned them in the way of affirming His Oneness and worship of Him and observe prayer maintaining it regularly and whose courses of action those courses of action that seem good to them are a matter of counsel between them in which they consult one another and do not act hastily and who of what We have bestowed on them expend in obedience to God — such mentioned individuals constitute one category;
Counsel,42,39,"And those who, when great wrong is done to them, defend themselves,",and those who when they suffer aggression injustice defend themselves — these are another category — that is to say they retaliate against those who wrong them in the same manner in which the latter wronged them as God exalted be He says
Counsel,42,40,"The guerdon of an ill-deed is an ill the like thereof. But whosoever pardoneth and amendeth, his wage is the affair of Allah. Lo! He loveth not wrong-doers.",For the requital of an evil deed is an evil deed like it the latter is also referred to as ‘an evil deed’ because in outward form it resembles the former; this is evident in what concerns retaliation for wounds. Some scholars say that even if another were to say ‘May God disgrace you!’ then one should respond equally with ‘May God disgrace you!’. But whoever pardons his wrongdoer and reconciles the amity between himself and the one pardoned his reward will be with God that is to say God will give him his reward without doubt. Truly He does not like wrongdoers that is those who initiate acts of wrongdoing and so merit His punishment.
Counsel,42,41,"And whoso defendeth himself after he hath suffered wrong - for such, there is no way (of blame) against them.",And whoever defends himself after he has been wronged that is to say after the wrongdoer has wronged him — for such there will be no course of action against them no blame on them.
Counsel,42,42,"The way (of blame) is only against those who oppress mankind, and wrongfully rebel in the earth.

Your duty is only to deliver the Message — this was revealed before the command to struggle against them. And indeed when We let man taste from Us some mercy some grace such as wealth and good health he exults in it; but if some ill some calamity befalls them the pronoun here refers to ‘man’ on the basis of the plural import of the generic noun because of what their own hands have sent ahead because of what they have offered of deeds — the expression refers to ‘the hands’ because most actions are effected by them then lo! man is ungrateful for the grace.

On the day when they see that which they are promised (it will seem to them) as though they had tarried but an hour of daylight. A clear message. Shall any be destroyed save evil-living folk ?",So endure with patience the harm done to you by your people just as the resolute those of constancy and power of endurance during hardships from among the messengers endured with patience before you so that you may be one of resolve like them min of mina’l-rusuli is explicative as all of them were men of resolve; but some say that this particle min is actually meant to be partitive since excluded from their number are Adam on the basis of God’s saying exalted be He And We did not find in him any constancy Q. 20115; and Jonah on the basis of His words And do not be like the One of the fish Q. 6848. And do not seek to hasten it for them for your people the sending down of the chastisement on them. Some say that he the Prophet seemed by this stage to have become exasperated because of them and desired that chastisement be sent down on them which is why he was enjoined to exercise patience and to refrain from hastening the chastisement for them — for it would befall them eventually without doubt. It shall seem for them on the day when they see what they are promised of chastisement in the Hereafter given its long duration as though they had tarried in this world by their reckoning only an hour of a day. This Qur’ān is a communication a proclamation from God to you. So shall any be destroyed that is to say none shall be destroyed upon seeing the chastisement but the immoral folk? that is to say the disbelieving folk.
Muhammad,47,1,"Those who disbelieve and turn (men) from the way of Allah, He rendereth their actions vain.",Those who disbelieve from among the people of Mecca and bar others from the way of God that is to say from faith He will leave their works to waste such as giving food to the poor or being kind to kin and so they will find no reward for these works of theirs in the Hereafter; but they are requited for them in this world purely out of His bounty exalted be He.
Muhammad,47,2,And those who believe and do good works and believe in that which is revealed unto Muhammad - and it is the truth from their Lord - He riddeth them of their ill-deeds and improveth their state.,But those who believe namely the Helpers al-Ansār and others like them and perform righteous deeds and believe in what has been revealed to Muhammad namely the Qur’ān — and it is the truth from their Lord — He will absolve them of He will forgive them their misdeeds and rightly dispose their mind their state so that they do not disobey Him.
Muhammad,47,3,That is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood and because those who believe follow the truth from their Lord. Thus Allah coineth their similitudes for mankind.,That rendering void of their works and the absolution of evil deeds is because those who disbelieve follow falsehood Satan and because those who believe follow the truth the Qur’ān from their Lord. Thus in the same manner of clarification does God strike for mankind similitudes of themselves that is how He clarifies for them their states in other words the disbeliever has his work rendered void while the believer is forgiven.
Muhammad,47,4,"Now when ye meet in battle those who disbelieve, then it is smiting of the necks until, when ye have routed them, then making fast of bonds; and afterward either grace or ransom till the war lay down its burdens. That (is the ordinance). And if Allah willed He could have punished them (without you) but (thus it is ordained) that He may try some of you by means of others. And those who are slain in the way of Allah, He rendereth not their actions vain.",So when you encounter in battle those who disbelieve then attack them with a striking of the necks fa-darba’l-riqābi is a verbal noun in place of the full verbal construction that is to say fa’dribū riqābahum ‘then strike their necks’ in other words slay them — reference is made to the ‘striking of the necks’ because the predominant cause of being slayed is to be struck in the neck. Then when you have made thoroughly decimated them bind spare them take them captive and bind firmly the bonds al-wathāq is what is used to bind yūthaqu a captive. Thereafter either set them free by grace mannan is a verbal noun in place of the full verbal construction that is to say either show them grace by setting them free unconditionally; or by ransom ransoming them with payment or with Muslim captives until the war that is to say its participants lay down its burdens its heavy loads of weaponry and other things so that either the disbelievers surrender or enter into a treaty. This last clause constitutes the ‘purpose’ of enjoining the Muslims to slaying and taking captive. So shall it be dhālika is the predicate of an implied subject such as al-amr ‘the ordinance’ in other words ‘the ordinance of God regarding them is as mentioned’. And had God willed He could have Himself taken vengeance on them without any fighting but He has commanded you to do it that He may test some of you by means of others from among them by way of battle so that the slain among you will end up in Paradise while those slain among them will end up in the Fire. And those who are slain qutilū a variant reading has qātalū ‘those who fight’ — this verse was revealed on the day of the battle of Uhud after the dead and the wounded had become numerous among the Muslims — in the way of God He will not let their works go to waste He will not render them void.
Muhammad,47,5,"He will guide them and improve their state,",He will guide them in this world and in the Hereafter to what benefits them and rightly dispose their minds their condition in both with that guidance and disposal in this world being for those who were not slain but who have been included in the statement ‘and those who were slain’ qutilū because of the predominance therein of those who were slain.
Muhammad,47,6,And bring them in unto the Garden which He hath made known to them.,And He will admit them into Paradise which He has made known which He has pointed out to them so that they are guided to their dwellings in it and to their spouses and servants without asking to be shown the way.
Muhammad,47,7,"O ye who believe! If ye help Allah, He will help you and will make your foothold firm.",O you who believe! If you help God that is to say His religion and His Messenger He will help you against your enemy and make your foothold firm He will make you stand firm while you fight on the battleground.
Muhammad,47,8,"And those who disbelieve, perdition is for them, and He will make their actions vain.",And as for those who disbelieve from among the people of Mecca wa’lladhīna kafarū is the subject the predicate of which is an implicit ta‘isū ‘they shall be wretched’ as indicated by what follows wretchedness shall be their lot that is destruction and defeat from God. And He will make their works go to waste wa-adalla a‘mālahum is a supplement to the implied ta‘isū ‘they shall be wretched’.
Muhammad,47,9,"That is because they are averse to that which Allah hath revealed, therefor maketh He their actions fruitless.",That wretchedness and wasting of their works is because they are averse to what God has revealed of the Qur’ān with all that it includes of religious obligations takālīf so He has made their works fail.
Muhammad,47,10,Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who were before them ? Allah wiped them out. And for the disbelievers there will be the like thereof.,Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? God destroyed them — He destroyed them their children and their possessions; and a fate the like thereof will be for the disbelievers that is to say the like of the fate of those before them.
Muhammad,47,11,"That is because Allah is patron of those who believe, and because the disbelievers have no patron.",
Muhammad,47,12,"Lo! Allah will cause those who believe and do good works to enter Gardens underneath which rivers flow; while those who disbelieve take their comfort in this life and eat even as the cattle eat, and the Fire is their habitation.",Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? God destroyed them — He destroyed them their children and their possessions; and a fate the like thereof will be for the disbelievers that is to say the like of the fate of those before them.
Muhammad,47,13,"And how many a township stronger than thy township (O Muhammad) which hath cast thee out, have We destroyed, and they had no helper!",And how many ka-ayyin means kam a town by which is meant the inhabitants thereof mightier in power than your town Mecca that is to say its inhabitants which expelled you akhrajatka is feminine despite the plural sense of inhabitants meant is because it takes into account the feminine form of qarya ‘town’ have We destroyed ahlaknāhum takes into account the former plural import of qarya ‘town’ and they had none to help them against Our destruction of them.
Muhammad,47,14,Is he who relieth on a clear proof from his Lord like those for whom the evil that they do is beautified while they follow their own lusts ?,Is he who follows a clear sign a definitive argument and proof from his Lord and these are the believers like those whose evil deeds have been adorned for them so that they see them as fair deeds and these are the disbelievers of Mecca and who follow their desires? by worshipping graven images. In other words there is no similarity between the two.
Muhammad,47,15,"A similitude of the Garden which those who keep their duty (to Allah) are promised: Therein are rivers of water unpolluted, and rivers of milk whereof the flavour changeth not, and rivers of wine delicious to the drinkers, and rivers of clear-run honey; therein for them is every kind of fruit, with pardon from their Lord. (Are those who enjoy all this) like those who are immortal in the Fire and are given boiling water to drink so that it teareth their bowels ?",A similitude a description of the Garden promised to the God-fearing the Garden that is shared equally by all those who enter it this first clause is the subject of which the predicate follows therein are rivers of unstaling water read āsin or asin similar in form to dārib ‘striker’ and hadhir ‘cautious’ that is to say one that does not change in contrast to the water of this world which may change due to some factor; and rivers of milk unchanging in flavour in contrast to the milk of this world on account of its issuing from udders and rivers of wine delicious to the drinkers in contrast to the wine of this world which is distasteful to drink; and also rivers of purified honey in contrast to the honey of this world which when it issues out of the bellies of bees becomes mixed with wax and other elements; and there will be for them therein varieties of every fruit and forgiveness from their Lord for He is pleased with them in addition to His beneficence towards them in the way mentioned in contrast to one who is a master of servants in this world who while being kind to them may at the same time be wrathful with them. Is such a one like him who abides in the Fire? ka-man huwa khālidun fī’l-nāri the predicate of an implied subject which is a-man huwa fī hādha’l-na‘īm ‘Is one who is amidst such bliss as him who abides in the Fire?’. And they will be given to drink boiling water which rips apart their bowels that is their entrails so that these will be excreted from their rears. Am‘ā’ ‘bowels’ is the plural of mi‘an its alif being derived from the yā’ of their saying mi‘yān as an alternative singular to mi‘an.
Muhammad,47,16,"Among them are some who give ear unto thee (Muhammad) till, when they go forth from thy presence they say unto those who have been given knowledge: What was that he said just now ? Those are they whose hearts Allah hath sealed, and they follow their own lusts.",And there are some among them namely the disbelievers who listen to you during the Friday sermon — and these are the hypocrites; until when they go forth from you they say to those who have been given knowledge that is to say to the knowledgeable ones among the Companions of the Prophet such as ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Mas‘ūd and ‘Abd Allāh Ibn ‘Abbās in derision and mockery ‘What was he saying just now?’ read ānifan or anifan meaning al-sā‘a ‘just now’. In other words they mean to say ‘we will not go back to listen to him again’. Those are the ones on whose hearts God has set a seal of disbelief and who follow their own desires in acting with hypocrisy.
Muhammad,47,17,"While as for those who walk aright, He addeth to their guidance, and giveth them their protection (against evil).",But those who are rightly guided namely the believers He God enhances their guidance and invests them with fear of Him He inspires them to do that by which they can be wary of ending up in the Fire.
Muhammad,47,18,"Await they aught save the Hour, that it should come upon them unawares ? And the beginnings thereof have already come. But how, when it hath come upon them, can they take their warning ?",Do they then await they do not await namely the disbelievers of Mecca anything except that the Hour should come upon them an ta’tiyahum is an inclusive substitution for al-sā‘ata ‘the Hour’; in other words it cannot be other than that it will come upon them … suddenly? For already its portents the signs thereof have come among which are the sending of the Prophet s the splitting of the Moon Q. 541 and the Smoke Q. 4410. So when it the Hour has come upon them for what benefit will their reminder be? their remembering; in other words it will be of no benefit to them.
Muhammad,47,19,"So know (O Muhammad) that there is no God save Allah, and ask forgiveness for thy sin and for believing men and believing women. Allah knoweth (both) your place of turmoil and your place of rest.",Know then that there is no god except God that is to say adhere O Muhammad (s) to knowledge of this fact that will benefit you at the Resurrection and ask forgiveness for your sin — this was said to him despite his infallibility ‘isma so that his community might emulate him in this respect. Indeed he did do this. The Prophet s said ‘Verily I do ask God for forgiveness a hundred times every day’ — and for the believing men and believing women — herein is an honouring for them by having their Prophet enjoined to ask forgiveness for them. And God knows your going to and fro your bustle during the day in pursuit of your business and your place of rest when you retire to where you sleep at night. In other words He has knowledge of all your states nothing of which can be hidden from Him so be mindful of Him — the address in this verse is meant for believers as well as others.
Muhammad,47,20,"And those who believe say: If only a surah were revealed! But when a decisive surah is revealed and war is mentioned therein, thou seest those in whose hearts is a disease looking at thee with the look of men fainting unto death. Therefor woe unto them!",And those who believe say seeking to take part in the struggle ‘Why has a sūra not been revealed?’ one in which there is mention of the command to participate in the struggle. But when a definitive sūra is revealed one in which nothing is abrogated naskh and fighting that is to say requirement for it is mentioned in it you see those in whose hearts is a sickness that is doubt — and they are the hypocrites — looking at you with the look of someone fainting at the point of death because of their fear of it and their aversion to it; in other words they fear fighting and are averse to it. Yet more fitting for them fa-awlā lahum is a subject the predicate of which is the following tā‘atun wa-qawlun ma‘rūfun
Muhammad,47,21,"Obedience and a civil word. Then, when the matter is determined, if they are loyal to Allah it will be well for them.",would be to offer obedience and honourable words that is words that are kind to you. Then when the matter has been resolved upon that is to say when fighting has been prescribed if they are loyal to God in faith and obedience it will be better for them the sentence beginning with law ‘if’ constitutes the response to idhā ‘when’.
Muhammad,47,22,"Would ye then, if ye were given the command, work corruption in the land and sever your ties of kinship ?",May it not be the case with you read ‘asītum or ‘asaytum; there is a shift here from the third person to the second person address that if you were to turn away if you were to shun faith you would then cause corruption in the land and sever your kinship ties? in other words that you would then return to the ways of pagandom such as belligerence and fighting.
Muhammad,47,23,Such are they whom Allah curseth so that He deafeneth them and maketh blind their eyes.,Those that is the agents of corruption are the ones whom God has cursed so made them deaf to hearing the truth and blinded their eyes to the path of guidance.
Muhammad,47,24,"Will they then not meditate on the Qur’an, or are there locks on the hearts ?",Do they not contemplate the Qur’ān? and so recognise the truth. Or am here is like bal ‘nay but’ is it that there are locks on their hearts? so they are unable to comprehend it.
Muhammad,47,25,"Lo! those who turn back after the guidance hath been manifested unto them, Satan hath seduced them, and He giveth them the rein.",Truly those who have turned by way of hypocrisy their backs after the guidance has become clear to them Satan has seduced he has adorned disbelief for them and has given them false hopes read wa-umliya lahum ‘false hopes have been given to them’ or wa-amlā lahum where the one who gives the false hopes is Satan but only by God’s will exalted be He for he Satan is the one who leads them astray.
Muhammad,47,26,That is because they say unto those who hate what Allah hath revealed: We will obey you in some matters; and Allah knoweth their secret talk.,That leading of them astray is because they said to those who were averse to what God revealed namely to the idolaters ‘We will obey you in some matters’ that is to say by cooperating to maintain enmity against the Prophet s and preventing people from participating in the struggle alongside him they had said as much secretly but God exalted be He exposed it; and God knows their secrets read asrārahum as the plural of sirr ‘a secret’ or isrārahum ‘their keeping of things secret’ as the verbal noun.
Muhammad,47,27,"Then how (will it be with them) when the angels gather them, smiting their faces and their backs!",Then how will it be their predicament when the angels take them away beating yadribūna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the angels their faces and their backs? with hooked iron rods.
Muhammad,47,28,"That will be because they followed that which angereth Allah, and hated that which pleaseth Him. Therefor He hath made their actions vain.",That taking of them away in the state mentioned is because they followed what angers God and because they were averse to what pleases Him that is to say they were averse to doing what pleases Him. Therefore He has made their works fail.
Muhammad,47,29,Or do those in whose hearts is a disease deem that Allah will not bring to light their (secret) hates ?,Or did those in whose hearts is a sickness suppose that God would not expose their rancour? that He would not bring to light their spite against the Prophet s and the believers.
Muhammad,47,30,"And if We would, We could show them unto thee (Muhammad) so that thou shouldst know them surely by their marks. And thou shalt know them by the burden of their talk. And Allah knoweth your deeds.",And if We will We could show them to you We could have pointed them out to you the lām is repeated in the following fa-la-‘araftahum then you would recognise them by their mark. And you will certainly recognise them wa-la-ta‘rifannahum the wāw is for an omitted oath and what follows it fī lahni’l-qawl is its response by their tone of speech that is to say by the meaning thereof when they speak in your presence alluding as they do to what amounts to a scathing attack upon the Muslims; and God knows your deeds.
Muhammad,47,31,"And verily We shall try you till We know those of you who strive hard (for the cause of Allah) and the steadfast, and till We test your record.",And We will assuredly try you We will assuredly test you by way of commanding you to participate in the struggle and in other ways until We know with knowledge outwardly manifested those of you who struggle for God’s cause and those who are steadfast in adhering to the struggle and in other ways and We will appraise We will reveal your record in terms of whether you acted with obedience or disobedience in what concerns the struggle all three verbs may be read with the third person singular yā’ or with the first person plural nūn.
Muhammad,47,32,"Lo! those who disbelieve and turn from the way of Allah and oppose the messenger after the guidance hath been manifested unto them, they hurt Allah not a jot, and He will make their actions fruitless.",Indeed those who disbelieve and bar from the way of God the path of truth and defy the Messenger opposing him after the guidance this is the meaning of ‘the way of God’ has become clear to them they will not hurt God in any way and He will make their works fail He will invalidate them good works such as voluntary alms and the like and so they will not find any reward for it in the Hereafter — this was revealed either regarding those Meccan participants at the battle of Badr who provided food for the needy or regarding the Jewish tribes of Qurayza and al-Nadīr.
Muhammad,47,33,"O ye who believe! Obey Allah and obey the messenger, and render not your actions vain.",O you who believe! Obey God and obey the Messenger and do not render your own works void by engaging in acts of disobedience for example.
Muhammad,47,34,"Lo! those who disbelieve and turn from the way of Allah and then die disbelievers, Allah surely will not pardon them.",Indeed those who disbelieve and bar from the way of God His path namely guidance and then die as disbelievers God will never forgive them — this was revealed regarding the men of the Well al-qalīb.
Muhammad,47,35,"So do not falter and cry out for peace when ye (will be) the uppermost, and Allah is with you, and He will not grudge (the reward of) your actions.",So do not falter do not be weak and do not call for peace read salm or silm that is to say a truce with the disbelievers should you encounter them when you have the upper hand al-a‘lawna the third letter of the triliteral root wāw has been omitted when you are the victors the vanquishers and God is with you helping and assisting and He will not stint you diminish you in the reward for your works that is to say of the reward for them.
Muhammad,47,36,"The life of the world is but a sport and a pastime. And if ye believe and ward off (evil). He will give you your wages, and will not ask of you your wordly wealth.",The life of this world that is to say preoccupation solely with it is merely play and diversion; but if you believe and are wary of God both of which pertain to the goal of the Hereafter He will give you your rewards and will not ask you your wealth in return all of it rather only the alms that are required from it.
Muhammad,47,37,"If He should ask it of you and importune you, ye would hoard it, and He would bring to light your (secret) hates.",If He were to ask you for it and press you demand it persistently you would be niggardly and this niggardliness would expose your rancour towards the religion of Islam.
Muhammad,47,38,"Lo! ye are those who are called to spend in the way of Allah, yet among you there are some who hoard. And as for him who hoardeth, he hoardeth only from his soul. And Allah is the Rich, and ye are the poor. And if ye turn away He will exchange you for some other folk, and they will not be the likes of you.",Lo! there you are O those who are being called to expend in the way of God that which has been prescribed for you; yet among you there are those who are niggardly; and whoever is niggardly is niggardly only to his own soul one may say bakhila ‘alayhi or bakhila ‘anhu to mean ‘he was niggardly to someone’. For God is the Independent One without need of your expending; while you are the needy of Him. And if you turn away from obedience to Him He will replace you with another people that is to say He will bring them in your place and they will not be the likes of you in turning away from obedience to Him but they will be obedient to Him Mighty and Majestic is He.
Victory,48,1,"Lo! We have given thee (O Muhammad) a signal victory,",Verily We have given you We have ordained for you the conquest fath of Mecca and other places in the future by force as a result of your struggle a clear victory one that is plain and manifest;
Victory,48,2,"That Allah may forgive thee of thy sin that which is past and that which is to come, and may perfect His favour unto thee, and may guide thee on a right path,",that God may forgive you by virtue of your struggle what is past of your sin and what is to come of it so that your community might then desire to struggle like you — this verse also constitutes a justification of the concept of the infallibility ‘isma of prophets peace be upon them against sin by way of a definitive rational proof the lām in li-yaghfira ‘that He may forgive’ is for indicating the ultimate reason for the conquest so that the content of this latter statement constitutes an effect and not the cause and that He may perfect by way of the mentioned victory His favour to you and guide you thereby to a straight path upon which He will confirm you — and this straight path is the religion of Islam;
Victory,48,3,And that Allah may help thee with strong help -,and that God may grant you therein a mighty victory one of glory involving no humiliation.
Victory,48,4,"He it is Who sent down peace of reassurance into the hearts of the believers that they might add faith unto their faith. Allah’s are the hosts of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is ever Knower, Wise -",He it is Who sent down the spirit of Peace Divine reassurance into the hearts of the believers that they might add faith to their faith by way of their embracing of the legal stipulations of religion for every time He revealed one of these they would believe in it — including the command to struggle. And to God belong the hosts of the heavens and the earth and so if He wanted to bring victory to His religion by means of others He would have done so. And God is ever Knower of His creatures Wise in His actions in other words He is ever possessed of such attributes;
Victory,48,5,"That He may bring the believing men and the believing women into Gardens underneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide, and may remit from them their evil deeds - That, in the sight of Allah, is the supreme triumph -",so that He may admit li-yudkhila is semantically connected to an omitted clause that is to say amara bi’l-jihād ‘He has enjoined the struggle so that He may admit’ the believing men and believing women into gardens underneath which rivers flow wherein they will abide and that He may absolve them of their misdeeds; for that in God’s sight is a supreme triumph;
Victory,48,6,"And may punish the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women, and the idolatrous men and the idolatrous women, who think an evil thought concerning Allah. For them is the evil turn of fortune, and Allah is wroth against them and hath cursed them, and hath made ready for them hell, a hapless journey’s end.",and so that He may chastise the hypocrites men and women and the idolaters men and women and those who make evil assumptions about God read al-saw’ or al-sū’ ‘evil’ in all three places; they assumed that He will not assist Muhammad (s) and the believers. For them will be an evil turn of fortune by way of abasement and chastisement; and God is wroth with them and He has cursed them He has banished them far from His mercy and has prepared for them Hell — and it is an evil destination! an evil place to return to.
Victory,48,7,"Allah’s are the hosts of the heavens and the earth, and Allah is ever Mighty, Wise.",And to God belong the hosts of the heavens and the earth; and God is ever Mighty in His kingdom Wise in His actions in other words He is ever possessed of such attributes.
Victory,48,8,"Lo! We have sent thee (O Muhammad) as a witness and a bearer of good tidings and a warner,",Indeed We have sent you as a witness against your community at the Resurrection and a bearer of good tidings to them in this world and a warner to threaten those in it who do evil with the punishment of the Fire;
Victory,48,9,"That ye (mankind) may believe in Allah and His messenger, and may honour Him, and may revere Him, and may glorify Him at early dawn and at the close of day.",that you may believe li-tu’minū may also here be read li-yu’minū ‘that they may believe’; and similarly read either the second person plural or the third person plural in the next three instances in God and His Messenger and that you may support Him tu‘azzirūhu a variant reading has tu‘azzizūhu and revere Him the third person suffixed pronoun -hu ‘him’ may refer either to God or to His Messenger and glorify Him that is God morning and evening.
Victory,48,10,"Lo! those who swear allegiance unto thee (Muhammad), swear allegiance only unto Allah. The Hand of Allah is above their hands. So whosoever breaketh his oath, breaketh it only to his soul’s hurt; while whosoever keepeth his covenant with Allah, on him will He bestow immense reward.",Truly those who pledge allegiance to you the ‘Pledge of Beatitude’ bay‘at al-ridwān given at al-Hudaybiyya in fact pledge allegiance to God — this statement is akin to Whoever obeys the Messenger verily obeys God Q. 480. The Hand of God is above their hands the hands with which they pledged allegiance to the Prophet in other words God exalted be He has observed their pledge of allegiance and will requite them in accordance with their adherence to it. So whoever reneges whoever breaches the pledge reneges — that is the evil consequences of his breach will eventually be — against his own soul; and whoever fulfils the covenant which he has made with God He will give him fa-sa-yu’tīhi; or read fa-sa-nu’tīhi ‘We will give him’ a great reward.
Victory,48,11,"Those of the wandering Arabs who were left behind will tell thee: Our possessions and our households occupied us, so ask forgiveness for us! They speak with their tongues that which is not in their hearts. Say: Who can avail you aught against Allah, if He intend you hurt or intend you profit ? Nay, but Allah is ever Aware of what ye do.",Those of the Bedouins who were left behind around Medina — that is to say those whom God made to stay behind and not to accompany you when you had asked them to set out with you for Mecca fearing that Quraysh would attack you upon your return in the year of al-Hudaybiyya — will say to you ‘Our possessions and our families kept us occupied preventing us from going forth with you. So ask forgiveness for us!’ of God for our failure to go forth with you. God exalted be He exposes their mendacity by saying They say with their tongues that is to say in asking forgiveness and in the preceding statement of theirs what is not in their hearts and so they are lying in the excuse which they give. Say ‘Who can an interrogative meant rhetorically as a negation that is to say ‘none can’ avail you anything against God should He desire to cause you harm read darran or durran or desire to bring you benefit? Nay but God is ever Aware of what you do in other words He is ever possessed of such an attribute.
Victory,48,12,"Nay, but ye deemed that the messenger and the believers would never return to their own folk, and that was made fairseeming in your hearts, and ye did think an evil thought, and ye were worthless folk.",Nay bal in both instances marks a transition from one subject to another but you thought that the Messenger and the believers would never return to their families and that thought was adorned in your hearts that is to say you thought that they would be annihilated by being slain and would not return and you thought evil thoughts that just mentioned and other things and you were a ruined lot’ būr is the plural of bā’ir in other words a lot to be destroyed according to God for having entertained such evil thoughts.
Victory,48,13,And so for him who believeth not in Allah and His messenger - Lo! We have prepared a flame for disbelievers.,And whoever does not believe in God and His Messenger We have prepared for the disbelievers a blaze a severe fire.

Nay, but they understand not, save a little.",Those mentioned who were left behind will say when you set forth after spoils namely the spoils of Khaybar in order to capture them ‘Let us follow you’ that we might also take a share of it. They desire thereby to change the words of God kalāma’Llāhi a variant reading has kalima’Llāhi in other words His promising of the spoils of Khaybar exclusively for those who were at al-Hudaybiyya. Say ‘You shall never follow us! Thus has God said beforehand’ that is prior to our return. Then they will say ‘Nay but you are envious of us’ lest we might acquire a share of the spoils and therefore you say this that you say. Nay but they never understood anything of religion all except a few of them.
Victory,48,16,"Say unto those of the wandering Arabs who were left behind: Ye will be called against a folk of mighty prowess, to fight them until they surrender; and if ye obey, Allah will give you a fair reward; but if ye turn away as ye did turn away before, He will punish you with a painful doom.",Say to those of the Bedouins mentioned who were left behind to test them ‘You shall be called against a people possessed of great might — these are said to have been the tribe of Banū Hanīfa the inhabitants of the region of al-Yamāma; but it is also said that these were the Persians and the Byzantines — you shall fight them tuqātilūnahum is a circumstancial qualifier referring to an implied future situation which constitutes that to which the ‘call’ will be made; or they will submit so that you will not have to fight. So if you obey the command to fight them God will give you a good reward; but if you turn away like you turned away before He will chastise you with a painful chastisement’.
Victory,48,17,"There is no blame for the blind, nor is there blame for the lame, nor is there blame for the sick (that they go not forth to war).

And He God knew what was in their hearts of sincerity and loyalty so He sent down the spirit of Peace upon them and rewarded them with a near victory which was the conquest of Khaybar following their departure from al-Hudaybiyya

So He has expedited this one the spoils of Khaybar for you and withheld men’s hands from you with regard to your families after you had set off on the campaign as the Jews had intended to plot against them; but God cast terror into their hearts; so that it the expedited one wa-li-takūna is a supplement to an implied verb that is to say li-tashkurūhu ‘that you may give thanks to Him’ may be a sign for the believers of their being assisted by God and that He may guide you on a straight path that is to say the way in which you should rely on Him and entrust any affair to Him exalted be He;

Victory,48,23,It is the law of Allah which hath taken course aforetime. Thou wilt not find for the law of Allah aught of power to change.,That is the way of God sunnata’Llāhi is a verbal noun emphasising the import of the preceding sentence about the defeat of the disbelievers and the victory of the believers that is to say sanna’Llāhu dhālika sunnatan ‘God has established this as His way of dealing with believers and disbelievers’ which has taken its course before and you will never find in God’s way any change by Him.

Victory,48,25,"These it was who disbelieved and debarred you from the Inviolable Place of Worship, and debarred the offering from reaching its goal. And if it had not been for believing men and believing women, whom ye know not - lest ye should tread them under foot and thus incur guilt for them unknowingly; that Allah might bring into His mercy whom He will - If (the believers and the disbelievers) had been clearly separated We verily had punished those of them who disbelieved with painful punishment.",They are the ones who disbelieved and barred you from the Sacred Mosque that is barred you from reaching it and prevented the offering wa’l-hadya is a supplement to the suffixed pronoun –kum ‘you’ of saddūkum ‘they barred you’ which was detained ma‘kūfan is a circumstantial qualifier from reaching its destination that is from the place at which it is customarily sacrificed namely the Sanctuary itself an yablugha mahillahu is an inclusive substitution. And were it not for some of the believing men and believing women being present at Mecca alongside the disbelievers whom you did not know to be believers — lest you should trample them that is to say lest you should slay them together with the disbelievers had you been given permission to embark on the conquest an tata’ūhum is an inclusive substitution for –hum ‘them’ of lam ta‘lamūhum ‘whom you did not know’ and thus incur sin on account of them without your knowing it … the third person pronouns in both groups of people predominantly imply males; the response to lawlā ‘were it not’ has been omitted through ellipsis being something along the lines of la-udhina lakum fī’l-fathi ‘you would have been permitted to embark on the conquest’ but permission for this was not given at the time so that God may admit into His mercy whom He will such as those believers mentioned. Had they been clearly separated had they the believers been distinguishable from the disbelievers We would have surely chastised the disbelievers among them of the people of Mecca immediately thereat by permitting you to go ahead with the conquest thereof with a painful chastisement.
Victory,48,26,"When those who disbelieve had set up in their hearts zealotry, the zealotry of the Age of Ignorance, then Allah sent down His peace of reassurance upon His messenger and upon the believers and imposed on them the word of self-restraint, for they were worthy of it and meet for it.

And God is ever Knower of all things that is to say He is ever possessed of such an attribute and among the things He knows is that they are worthy of it.
Victory,48,27,"Allah hath fulfilled the vision for His messenger in very truth.

He informed his Companions of this and they rejoiced. But when they set off with him from Medina and the disbelievers impeded them at al-Hudaybiyya such that they had to retreat which was distressing for them for some of the hypocrites began to have doubts about the Prophet’s sincerity this verse was revealed bi’l-haqqi ‘in all truth’ is semantically connected to sadaqa ‘fulfilled’ or it is a circumstantial qualifier referring to al-ru’yā ‘the vision’ and what comes after it is the explanation thereof ‘You will assuredly enter the Sacred Mosque God willing — this is said to secure blessings — in safety to shave your heads that is all the hair or to shorten it to shorten some of the hair both muhalliqīna and muqassirīna are implied circumstantial qualifiers without any fear’ ever.

Victory,48,29,"Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. And those with him are hard against the disbelievers and merciful among themselves. Thou (O Muhammad) seest them bowing and falling prostrate (in worship), seeking bounty from Allah and (His) acceptance. The mark of them is on their foreheads from the traces of prostration. Such is their likeness in the Torah and their likeness in the Gospel - like as sown corn that sendeth forth its shoot and strengtheneth it and riseth firm upon its stalk, delighting the sowers - that He may enrage the disbelievers wiith (the sight of) them.

You see you observe them bowing prostrating in worship both rukka‘an and sujjadan are circumstantial qualifiers. They seek yabtaghūna is the beginning of a new sentence bounty from God and beatitude. Their mark sīmāhum is a subject their distinguishing feature is on their faces fī wujūhihim is its predicate this is a light and a radiance by which in the Hereafter they will be recognised as having been those who used to prostrate in this world from the effect of prostration min athari’l-sujūdi is semantically connected to the same thing to which the predicate is semantically connected that is to say kā’inatan ‘this being from the effect of prostration’; syntactically it is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the subject of kā’inatan which is also the subject of the predicate sc. wujūhihim ‘their faces’. That mentioned description is their description mathaluhum is the subject in the Torah fī’l-tawrāti is the predicate thereof; and their description in the Gospel wa-mathaluhum fī’l-injīli is a subject the predicate of which is what follows is as a seed that sends forth its shoot read shat’ahu or shata’ahu and strengthens it read āzarahu or azarahu nourishing it and assisting it and it grows stout and rises firmly becoming strong and upright upon its stalk its roots sūq is the plural of sāq delighting the sowers that is to say those who planted it on account of its fairness. The Companions may God be pleased with them are being described in this way for at the outset they were weak and very few in number; but then their number grew and they acquired strength in the most wholesome way so that He may enrage the disbelievers by them li-yaghīza bihimu’l-kuffāra is semantically connected to an omitted clause which is suggested by what preceded that is to say ‘they are likened to this so that God may enrage the disbelievers’. God has promised those of them who believe and perform righteous deeds the Companions minhum ‘of them’ min ‘of’ is an indicator of the genus and not partitive for they are all possessed of the mentioned attributes forgiveness and a great reward — Paradise. Both of these rewards will also be given to those who will come after them as is stated in other verses.

The Moon,54,15,And verily We left it as a token; but is there any that remembereth ?,And verily We left it We preserved this deed as a sign for whomever might be admonished by it in other words the news of this deed became widely-known and endured.

Then indeed we should fall into error and madness.",and they said ‘Is it a mortal basharan is in the accusative because it is governed by a succeeding verb alone among us minnā wāhidan are both adjectives of basharan that we are to follow? nattabi‘uhu this explains the verb which renders it basharan ‘mortal’ accusative; the interrogative is meant as a negative in other words why should we follow him when there are many of us and he is only one among us and not a king? That is to say we will not follow him. Then indeed if we were to follow him we would be in error a parting with reason and insanity!
The Moon,54,25,"Hath the remembrance been given unto him alone among us ? Nay, but he is a rash liar.",Has the Reminder the revelation been cast read a-ulqiya pronouncing both hamzas or by not pronouncing the second one but in both cases inserting an intervening alif or leaving this insertion out upon him alone from among us? in other words nothing has been revealed to him.

So was the squall unleashed at first with the family of Lot still there? There are two opinions regarding this in the case of the former that it was unleashed upon them including the family of Lot the exception is understood as a continuous one while in the case of the latter opinion that they were delivered before the squall the exception is understood as a discontinuous one even if it ‘the family of Lot’ is actually subsumed by the collective noun ‘the people of Lot’ and so they were delivered as a kindness from God;
The Moon,54,35,As grace from Us. Thus We reward him who giveth thanks.,as a grace ni‘matan is a verbal noun that is to say in‘āman ‘an act of grace’ from Us.

Iron,57,13,"On the day when the hypocritical men and the hypocritical women will say unto those who believe: Look on us that we may borrow from your light! it will be said: Go back and seek for light!

They will say: Yea, verily; but ye tempted one another, and hesitated, and doubted, and vain desires beguiled you till the ordinance of Allah came to pass; and the deceiver deceived you concerning Allah;",They will call out to them ‘Did we not use to be with you?’ upon the path of obedience. They will say ‘Yes indeed!

Those — they are the sincere in their faith.
Exile,59,9,"Those who entered the city and the faith before them love those who flee unto them for refuge, and find in their breasts no need for that which hath been given them, but prefer (the fugitives) above themselves though poverty become their lot.

And for them there will be a painful chastisement in the Hereafter.
Exile,59,16,"(And the hypocrites are) on the likeness of the devil when he telleth man to disbelieve, then, when he disbelieveth saith: Lo! I am quit of thee. Lo! I fear Allah, the Lord of the Worlds.",In addition their likeness in heeding the words of the hypocrites and their forsaking of them is like Satan when he says to man ‘Disbelieve!’; so that when he man disbelieves he says ‘Lo! I am absolved of you. Indeed I fear God the Lord of the Worlds’ out of mendacity and dissimulation on his part.

The Prophet s intercepted it from the person to whom he Hātib had given it to deliver after God apprised him of this. Hātib’s excuse for this conduct of his was accepted by the Prophet; when verily they have disbelieved in the truth that has come to you that is in the religion of Islam and the Qur’ān expelling the Messenger and you from Mecca by oppressing you because you believe in God your Lord. If you have gone forth to struggle in My way and to seek My pleasure … the response to the conditional is indicated by what preceded that is to say understand it as being ‘then do not take them as friends’.

Thus the two groups waged war against one another. Then We strengthened those who believed of the two groups against their enemy the disbelieving groups and so they became the triumphant the victors.

The Congregation,62,4,That is the bounty of Allah; which He giveth unto whom He will. Allah is of Infinite Bounty.,That is the bounty of God which He gives to whom He will — such as the Prophet and those mentioned with him — and God is dispenser of tremendous bounty.
The Congregation,62,5,"The likeness of those who are entrusted with the Law of Moses, yet apply it not, is as the likeness of the ass carrying books. Wretched is the likeness of folk who deny the revelations of Allah. And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.",The likeness of those who were entrusted with the Torah those who were charged with implementing it then failed to uphold it then failed to act in accordance with it in what pertains to the descriptions of the Prophet s and so did not believe in him is as the likeness of an ass carrying books in that it does not benefit from them. Evil is the likeness of the people who deny God’s signs those confirming the truth of the Prophet s — the object of rebuke is omitted but is implied to be hādhā’l-mathalu ‘this likeness’. And God does not guide the evildoing folk the disbelievers.
The Congregation,62,6,"Say (O Muhammad): O ye who are Jews! If ye claim that ye are favoured of Allah apart from (all) mankind, then long for death if ye are truthful.",Say ‘O you of Jewry if you claim that you are the favoured friends of God to the exclusion of other people then long for death if you are truthful’ in kuntum sādiqīna is semantically connected to tamannū ‘long for’; as for the two conditions the first is dependent on the second that is to say if you are truthful in your claim that you are the favoured friends of God and given that such a friend would prefer the Hereafter to this world and that it the Hereafter begins at death then long for it.
The Congregation,62,7,"But they will never long for it because of all that their own hands have sent before, and Allah is Aware of evil-doers.",But they will never long for it because of what their hands have sent ahead in the way of their disbelief of the Prophet which itself is a necessary consequence of their denial; and God is Knower of the evildoers the disbelievers.

The Congregation,62,11,"But when they spy some merchandise or pastime they break away to it and leave thee standing. Say: That which Allah hath is better than pastime and than merchandise, and Allah is the Best of providers.",On one occasion the Prophet s was delivering the Friday sermon when a caravan arrived and so as was the custom drums were beaten to announce its arrival whereat the people began to leave the mosque to go to it all except for twelve men. The following verse was then revealed But when they sight some opportunity for business or a diversion they scatter off towards it that is towards the business since it is what they seek more than diversion and leave you during the sermon standing. Say ‘That which is with God in the way of reward is better for those who believe than diversion and commerce. And God is the best of providers’. They say that every person ‘provides for’ yarzuqu his dependants by which they mean that such a person does so by means of the provision given by God min rizqi’Llāhi exalted be He.
The Hypocrites,63,1,"When the hypocrites come unto thee (O Muhammad), they say: We bear witness that thou art indeed Allah’s messenger. And Allah knoweth that thou art indeed His messenger, and Allah beareth witness that the hypocrites indeed are speaking falsely.",When the hypocrites come to you they say with their tongues in contradiction of what is in their hearts ‘We bear witness that you are indeed the Messenger of God.’ And God knows that you are indeed His Messenger and God bears witness He knows that the hypocrites truly are liars in what they conceal that which is contrary to what they say.
The Hypocrites,63,2,"They make their faith a pretext so that they may turn (men) from the way of Allah. Verily evil is that which they are wont to do,",They have taken their oaths as a shield as a means of protection for their possessions and their lives and so they have barred thereby from the way of God that is from using them for the struggle. Evil indeed is that which they are wont to do.
The Hypocrites,63,3,"That is because they believed, then disbelieved, therefore their hearts are sealed so that they understand not.",That namely their evil deed is because they believed by affirming faith only with the tongue then disbelieved in their hearts that is to say they persist in harbouring disbelief in it; therefore their hearts have been stamped sealed with disbelief. Hence they do not understand faith.
The Hypocrites,63,4,"And when thou seest them their figures please thee; and if they speak thou givest ear unto their speech. (They are) as though they were blocks of wood in striped cloaks. They deem every shout to be against them. They are the enemy, so beware of them. Allah confound them! How they are perverted!",And when you see them their figures please you on account of their fairness; and if they speak you listen to their speech because of its eloquence. Yet they are by virtue of the enormous size of their figures yet in their lack of comprehension like blocks of timber read khushbun or khushubun that have been propped-up set reclining against a wall. They assume that every cry made like a battle-cry or one made to retrieve a lost camel is directed against them because of the extent of terror in their hearts lest something should be revealed deeming their blood licit. They are the enemy so beware of them for they communicate your secrets to the disbelievers. May God assail them! destroy them! How can they deviate? how can they be turned away from faith after the proofs for it have been established?
The Hypocrites,63,5,"And when it is said unto them: Come! The messenger of Allah will ask forgiveness for you! they avert their faces and thou seest them turning away, disdainful.",And when it is said to them ‘Come offer apologies and God’s Messenger will ask forgiveness for you’ they twist read lawwaw or lawū they turn their heads and you see them turning away rejecting this offer disdainful.

Allah guideth not the evil-living folk.,It will be the same for them whether you ask forgiveness for them a’staghfarta the interrogative hamza here has taken the place of the conjunctive hamza or do not ask forgiveness for them God will never forgive them. Indeed God does not guide the immoral folk.
The Hypocrites,63,7,They it is who say: Spend not on behalf of those (who dwell) with Allah’s messenger that they may disperse (and go away from you); when Allah’s are the treasures of the heavens and the earth; but the hypocrites comprehend not.,They are the ones who say to their companions from among the Helpers ‘Do not expend on those who are with the Messenger of God from among the Emigrants until they scatter off’ until they part with him. Yet to God belong the treasuries of the heavens and the earth with what they contain of provision and so He is the provider for the Emigrants and others but the hypocrites do not understand.
The Hypocrites,63,8,"They say: Surely, if we return to Al-Madinah the mightier will soon drive out the weaker; when might belongeth to Allah and to His messenger and to the believers; but the hypocrites know not.",They say ‘Surely if we return from the raid against the Banū al-Mustaliq to Medina the powerful by which they meant themselves will soon expel from it the weaker’ by which they meant the believers. Yet the real might victory belongs to God and to His Messenger and to the believers but the hypocrites do not know that.
The Hypocrites,63,9,"O ye who believe! Let not your wealth nor your children distract you from remembrance of Allah. Those who do so, they are the losers.",O you who believe do not let your possessions and your children divert you distract you from the remembrance of God from the five prayers; for whoever does that — it is they who are the losers.
The Hypocrites,63,10,"And spend of that wherewith We have provided you before death cometh unto one of you and he saith: My Lord! If only thou wouldst reprieve me for a little while, then I would give alms and be among the righteous.",And expend in alms of that with which We have provided you before death comes to any of you whereat he will say ‘My Lord if only law-lā means hal-lā ‘why do You not’; or the lā is extra and the law is optative You would reprieve me for a short time so that I might give charity assaddaq the original tā’ of atasaddaqa has been assimilated with the sād that I might offer alms and become one of the righteous!’ by making the Pilgrimage. Ibn ‘Abbās may God be pleased with both him and his father said ‘Every person who has fallen short of his duty regarding alms and the Pilgrimage will ask to be returned to this world at the moment of death’.
The Hypocrites,63,11,"But Allah reprieveth no soul when its term cometh, and Allah is Informed of what ye do.",But God will never reprieve a soul when its term has come. And God is Aware of what you do ta‘malūna; also read as the third person plural ya‘malūna ‘they do’.

So they disbelieved and turned away, and Allah was independent (of them). Allah is Absolute, Owner of Praise.",That chastisement in this world is because bi-annahu contains the pronoun of the matter their messengers used to bring them clear signs manifest proofs for the validity of faith but they said ‘Shall mere humans basharan is meant as generic be our guides?’ So they disbelieved and turned away from faith and God was independent without need of their faith. And God is Independent without need of His creatures Praised praiseworthy in His actions.

Guard yourselves and your families by enjoining obedience to God against a Fire whose fuel is disbelieving people and stones such as those idols of theirs made of that stone — the meaning is that it is extremely hot fuelled by the above-mentioned unlike the fire of this world which is fuelled by wood and the like — over which stand angels its keepers — numbering nineteen as will be stated in sūrat al-Muddaththir Q. 7430 — stern a sternness of the heart mighty in their power of assault who do not disobey God in what He commands them mā amarahum is a substitution for His Majesty ‘God’ in other words they do not disobey the command of God but do what they are commanded — this is reiterated for emphasis; the verse is meant as a threat to deter believers from apostatising and for hypocrites who believe only with their tongues and not with their hearts.
Banning,66,7,(Then it will be said): O ye who disbelieve! Make no excuses for yourselves this day. Ye are only being paid for what ye used to do.,‘O you who disbelieve! Do not make any excuses today — this is said to them upon their entering the Fire — in other words because this excusing will be of no use to you. You are only being requited for what you used to do’ that is only the due requital thereof.
Banning,66,8,"O ye who believe! Turn unto Allah in sincere repentance! It may be that your Lord will remit from you your evil deeds and bring you into Gardens underneath which rivers flow, on the day when Allah will not abase the Prophet and those who believe with him. Their light will run before them and on their right hands; they will say: Our Lord! Perfect our light for us, and forgive us! Lo! Thou art Able to do all things.",O you who believe! Repent to God with sincere repentance read nasūhan or nusūhan a truthful repentance so that one does not return to committing that sin again nor have the desire to return to it. It may be that your Lord ‘asā an expression denoting ‘a hope’ that will be realised will absolve you of your misdeeds and admit you into gardens orchards underneath which rivers flow on the day when God will not let down by admitting into the Fire the Prophet and those who believe with him. Their light will be running before them in front of them and it will be on their right. They will say yaqūlūna this denotes the beginning of a new syntactically independent sentence ‘Our Lord! Perfect our light for us towards Paradise — whereas the hypocrites their light will be extinguished — and forgive us Our Lord. Assuredly You have power over all things’.

Banning,66,10,"Allah citeth an example for those who disbelieve: the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot, who were under two of Our righteous slaves yet betrayed them so that they (the husbands) availed them naught against Allah and it was said (unto them): Enter the Fire along with those who enter.",God has struck a similitude for those who disbelieve the wife of Noah and the wife of Lot. They were under two of Our righteous servants yet they betrayed them in their religion for they both disbelieved — Noah’s wife called Wāhila used to say to his people that he was a madman while Lot’s wife called Wā‘ila used to tell his people the whereabouts of his guests when they stayed with him at night by lighting a fire and during the day by making smoke. So they that is Noah and Lot did not avail the two women in any way against God against His chastisement and it was said to the two women ‘Enter both of you the Fire along with the incomers’ from among the disbelievers of the peoples of Noah and Lot.
Banning,66,11,"And Allah citeth an example for those who believe: the wife of Pharaoh when she said: My Lord! Build for me a home with thee in the Garden, and deliver me from Pharaoh and his work, and deliver me from evil- doing folk;",And God has struck a similitude for those who believe the wife of Pharaoh — she believed in Moses her name was Āsiya; Pharaoh chastised her by tying her hands and feet to pegs and placing a huge millstone on her chest and having her laid out in the sun; but when those in charge of her would leave her the angels would come to shade her — when she said during her torture ‘My Lord build for me a home near You in Paradise — so He disclosed for her a veil of the Unseen and she saw it which in turn alleviated for her the torture — and deliver me from Pharaoh and his work his torture and deliver me from the evildoing folk’ the followers of his Pharaoh’s religion whereat God took unto Himself her spirit in death. Ibn Kaysān said ‘She was raised to Paradise alive where she eats and drinks’.
Banning,66,12,"And Mary, daughter of ’Imran, whose body was chaste, therefor We breathed therein something of Our Spirit. And she put faith in the words of her Lord and His scriptures, and was of the obedient.",And Mary wa-Maryama is a supplement to imra’ata Fir‘awna daughter of ‘Imrān who preserved the chastity of her womb so We breathed into it of Our Spirit namely Gabriel — when he breathed into the opening of her shirt by God’s creation of this action of his which reached her womb thus conceiving Jesus — and she confirmed the words of her Lord His prescriptions and His revealed Scriptures and she was of the obedient one of the obedient folk.

The Sovereignty,67,2,"Who hath created life and death that He may try you which of you is best in conduct; and He is the Mighty, the Forgiving,",He Who created death in this world and life in the Hereafter — or both of them in this world since the sperm-drop is imbued with life life being that power by which sensation becomes possible death being the opposite of this or the non-existence of it — these being two alternative opinions; in the case of the latter life in the Hereafter ‘creation’ implies ‘ordainment’ — that He may try you that He may test you in this life to see which of you is best in conduct which of you is most obedient to God and He is the Mighty in His vengeance against those who disobey Him the Forgiving to those who repent to Him;
The Sovereignty,67,3,Who hath created seven heavens in harmony. Thou (Muhammad) canst see no fault in the Beneficent One’s creation; then look again: Canst thou see any rifts ?,Who created seven heavens in layers one above the other without any contact between them. You do not see in the Compassionate One’s creation of these or of other things any irregularity any disparity or discordance. Then cast your eyes again turn them toward the heaven Do you see in it any fissure? any cracks or ruptures?
The Sovereignty,67,4,"Then look again and yet again, thy sight will return unto thee weakened and made dim.",Then cast your eyes yet again once and then twice and your sight will return to you humbled abject on account of it not perceiving any fissure and wearied unable to see any fissure.
The Sovereignty,67,5,"And verily We have beautified the world’s heaven with lamps, and We have made them missiles for the devils, and for them We have prepared the doom of flame.",And verily We have adorned the lowest heaven the one closest to the earth with lamps with stars and made them missiles against the devils should they attempt to listen by stealth in which case a meteor of fire detaches itself from the star just like a brand is taken from a fire and either kills that jinn or deprives him of his senses it is not that the star itself is displaced from its position; and We have prepared for them the chastisement of the Blaze the ignited Fire.
The Sovereignty,67,6,"And for those who disbelieve in their Lord there is the doom of hell, a hapless journey’s end!",And for those who disbelieve in their Lord there is the chastisement of Hell and what an evil journey’s end! it is.
The Sovereignty,67,7,"When they are flung therein they hear its roaring as it boileth up,",When they are flung into it they hear it blaring producing a horrid sound like that of an ass as it seethes
The Sovereignty,67,8,As it would burst with rage. Whenever a (fresh) host is flung therein the wardens thereof ask them: Came there unto you no warner ?,almost exploding tamayyazu a variant reading has the original form tatamayyazu ripped apart with rage in wrath against the disbelievers. Whenever a host a group of them is flung into it its keepers ask them an interrogation of rebuke ‘Did there not come to you a warner?’ a messenger to warn you of God’s chastisement.
The Sovereignty,67,9,"They say: Yea, verily, a warner came unto us; but we denied and said: Allah hath naught revealed; ye are in naught but a great error.",They will say ‘Yes a warner did indeed come to us but we denied and said “God has not revealed anything; you are assuredly in great error”’ this last words may be the words of the angels spoken to the disbelievers when they are told of the denial or they may belong to the words of the disbelievers spoken to the warners.
The Sovereignty,67,10,"And they say: Had we been wont to listen or have sense, we had not been among the dwellers in the flames.",And they will say ‘Had we listened that is listening so as to understand or comprehended that is comprehension entailing reflection upon the truth we would not have been among the inhabitants of the Blaze’.
The Sovereignty,67,11,So they acknowledge their sins; but far removed (from mercy) are the dwellers in the flames.,Thus they will confess when confession is of no avail their sin which was their denial of the warners. So away suhqan or suhuqan with the inhabitants of the Blaze! so far away may they be from God’s mercy.
The Sovereignty,67,12,"Lo! those who fear their Lord in secret, theirs will be forgiveness and a great reward.",Assuredly those who fear their Lord in secret while they are absent from people’s eyes being obedient to Him in secret such that openly before people it is all the more likely that they fear their Lord — there will be for them forgiveness and a great reward namely Paradise.
The Sovereignty,67,13,"And keep your opinion secret or proclaim it, lo! He is Knower of all that is in the breasts (of men).",And whether you keep secret O people your speech or proclaim it He indeed exalted be He is Knower of what is in the breasts of what they contain so how much more so is He Knower in the case of what you utter openly — the reason for the revelation of this verse was that the idolaters said to one another ‘Speak secretly and Muhammad’s god will not hear you’.
The Sovereignty,67,14,"Should He not know what He created ? And He is the Subtile, the Aware.",Will He Who has created not know? what you keep secret in other words will His knowledge of things be precluded by such secret speech? And He is the Subtle in His knowledge the Aware therein.

And unto Him will be the resurrection (of the dead).",It is He Who made the earth tractable for you easy for you to walk on; so walk in its flanks and eat of His provision that has been created for you; and to Him is the resurrection from the graves for the Requital.
The Sovereignty,67,16,Have ye taken security from Him Who is in the heaven that He will not cause the earth to swallow you when lo! it is convulsed ?,Are you secure read a-amintum pronouncing both hamzas fully or by not pronouncing the second one inserting an alif between it and the other one or without the insertion but replacing it with an alif instead in thinking that He Who is in the heaven that He Whose authority and power is in the heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you an yakhsifa substitutes for man ‘He Who’ while it quakes? while it moves underneath you and rises above you?
The Sovereignty,67,17,Or have ye taken security from Him Who is in the heaven that He will not let loose on you a hurricane ? But ye shall know the manner of My warning.,Are you secure in thinking that He Who is in the heaven will not unleash an yursila substitutes for man ‘He Who’ upon you a squall of pebbles? a wind hurling pebbles at you. But you will soon come to know upon seeing the chastisement with your own eyes the nature of My warning My warning of chastisement in other words you will soon see that it was true.
The Sovereignty,67,18,"And verily those before them denied, then (see) the manner of My wrath (with them)!",And verily those communities who were before them denied then see how was My rebuttal! how was My rebuttal of them in destroying them when they denied in other words how it was true.
The Sovereignty,67,19,Have they not seen the birds above them spreading out their wings and closing them ? Naught upholdeth them save the Beneficent. Lo! He is Seer of all things.,Or have they not seen the birds above them in the air spreading their wings and closing? their wings after spreading them? in other words read wa-yaqbidna as wa-qābidātin similar to sāffātin ‘spreading’. Nothing sustains them from falling either when they are spreading them or closing them except the Compassionate One by His power. Indeed He is Seer of all things. The meaning is have they not inferred from the fact that the birds are able to remain in the air that We have the power to do with them what has been mentioned above as well as inflicting upon them other kinds of chastisement?
The Sovereignty,67,20,Or who is he that will be an army unto you to help you instead of the Beneficent ? The disbelievers are in naught but illusion.,Or who am-man the subject is it hādhā its predicate that alladhī a substitution for hādhā ‘is it’ will be an army supporters for you lakum belongs to the relative clause of alladhī ‘that’ to help you yansurukum is an adjectival qualification of jundun ‘an army’ besides the Compassionate One? that is to say other than Him who is there that will be able to avert His chastisement from you in other words you have no helper. The disbelievers are in nothing but delusion Satan has deluded them into believing that the chastisement will not befall them.
The Sovereignty,67,21,"Or who is he that will provide for you if He should withhold His providence ? Nay, but they are set in pride and frowardness.",Or who is it that will provide for you if He the Compassionate One withholds His provision? that is to say if He withholds the rain from you the response to the conditional has been omitted but is indicated by what preceded it namely the statement to the effect ‘who will provide for you?’ and so the response would be you have no provider other than Him. Nay but they persist in disdain and aversion moving away further from the truth.
The Sovereignty,67,22,"Is he who goeth groping on his face more rightly guided, or he who walketh upright on a straight road ?",Is he who walks cast down fallen on his face more rightly guided or he who walks upright on a straight path? the predicate of the second man ‘who’ has been omitted but is indicated by the predicate of the first namely ahdā ‘more rightly guided’; the similitude refers to the believer and the disbeliever and to which of the two is more rightly guided.
The Sovereignty,67,23,"Say (unto them, O Muhammad): He it is who gave you being, and hath assigned unto you ears and eyes and hearts. Small thanks give ye!",Say ‘It is He Who created you and endowed you with hearing and sight and hearts. Little do you thank!’ mā tashkurūna mā is extra; the sentence itself is a new independent one informing of how extremely little they give thanks for these graces.
The Sovereignty,67,24,"Say: He it is Who multiplieth you in the earth, and unto Whom ye will be gathered.",Say ‘It is He Who multiplied you created you on earth and to Him you will be gathered’ for the Reckoning.
The Sovereignty,67,25,"And they say: When (will) this promise (be fulfilled), if ye are truthful ?",And they say to the believers ‘When will this promise be fulfilled the promise of the gathering if you are truthful?’ about it.
The Sovereignty,67,26,"Say: The knowledge is with Allah only, and I am but a plain warner;",Say ‘The knowledge of its coming is only with God and I am but a plain warner’ one whose warning is plain.
The Sovereignty,67,27,"But when they see it nigh, the faces of those who disbelieve will be awry, and it will be said (unto them): This is that for which ye used to call.",But when they see it that is the chastisement after the gathering near at hand the faces of those who disbelieved will be awry blackened and it will be said that is the keepers of Hell will say to them ‘This is that chastisement which the warning of which you used to make claims about’ claims to the effect that you would not be resurrected — this is the narration of a situation that will take place in the future and which has been expressed using the past tense in order to confirm that it will actually take place.
The Sovereignty,67,28,"Say (O Muhammad): Have ye thought: Whether Allah causeth me (Muhammad) and those with me to perish or hath mercy on us, still, who will protect the disbelievers from a painful doom ?",Say ‘Have you considered If God destroys me and those with me of believers by His chastisement as you would have it or has mercy on us and does not chastise us who then will protect the disbelievers from a painful chastisement?’ in other words they will have no protector from it.
The Sovereignty,67,29,Say: He is the Beneficent. In Him we believe and in Him we put our trust. And ye will soon know who it is that is in error manifest.,Say ‘He is the Compassionate One; we believe in Him and in Him we put our trust. And assuredly you will soon know sa-ta‘lamūna is also read sa-ya‘lamūna ‘they will know’ upon seeing the chastisement with your own eyes who is in manifest error’ is it us or yourselves or them?
The Sovereignty,67,30,"Say: Have ye thought: If (all) your water were to disappear into the earth, who then could bring you gushing water ?",Say ‘Have you considered If your water were to sink deep into the earth who then will bring you running water?’ which hands and buckets would be able to reach like they do your water in other words none but God exalted be He would be able to bring it so how can you reject that He will resurrect you? It is commendable for one to say Allāhu rabbu’l-‘ālamīna ‘God Lord of the Worlds!’ after ma‘īn ‘running water’ as is stated in a hadīth. This verse was recited before a certain tyrant who then replied ‘Hatchets and pickaxes will bring it!’ whereupon the water of his eyes dried up and he became blind. We seek refuge with God against that we should be insolent towards Him or His verses.

The Jinn,72,6,"And indeed (O Muhammad) individuals of humankind used to invoke the protection of individuals of the jinn, so that they increased them in revolt against Allah);",And that certain individuals of mankind used to seek the protection of certain individuals of the jinn when they stopped over in dangerous places during their journeys — whereat every man would say ‘I seek the protection of the lord of this place against the evil of the insolent ones in it’ — so that they increased them by their seeking their protection in oppressiveness such that they would say ‘We are now lords of jinn and humans!’.
The Jinn,72,7,"And indeed they supposed, even as ye suppose, that Allah would not raise anyone (from the dead) -",And they namely the jinn thought just as you O humans thought that an softened in place of the hardened form that is to say annahu God would never raise anyone after his death.
The Jinn,72,8,And (the Jinn who had listened to the Qur’an said): We had sought the heaven but had found it filled with strong warders and meteors.,The jinn say And we made for the heaven we desired to listen by stealth but we found it filled with mighty guards from among the angels and meteors scorching stars this was at the time of the sending of the Prophet s.
The Jinn,72,9,And we used to sit on places (high) therein to listen. But he who listeneth now findeth a flame in wait for him;,And we used to that is to say before his Mission sit in certain places therein to listen in; but anyone listening now will find a meteor lying in wait for him aimed at him ready to strike him.
The Jinn,72,10,"And we know not whether harm is boded unto all who are in the earth, or whether their Lord intendeth guidance for them.",And we do not know by not being able to eavesdrop by stealth whether ill is intended for those who are in the earth or whether their Lord intends for them good.
The Jinn,72,11,And among us there are righteous folk and among us there are far from that. We are sects having different rules.,And that among us some have become righteous after having listened to the Qur’ān and some of us are otherwise that is to say a folk who are unrighteous; we are made up of different sects opposing groups some submitters to God and others disbelievers.
The Jinn,72,12,"And we know that we cannot escape from Allah in the earth, nor can we escape by flight.",And we assume that an softened in place of the hardened form that is to say annahu we will never be able to elude God in the earth nor will we be able to elude Him by fleeing — we will not be able to escape Him whether we are on earth or fleeing from it in the heavens.
The Jinn,72,13,"And when we heard the guidance, we believed therein, and whoso believeth in his Lord, he feareth neither loss nor oppression.",And that when we heard the guidance the Qur’ān we believed in it. For whoever believes in his Lord read an implied huwa ‘he’ before fa-lā yakhāfu shall fear neither loss a diminishing of his good deeds nor oppression nor injustice by having his evil deeds increased.
The Jinn,72,14,"And there are among us some who have surrendered (to Allah) and there are among us some who are unjust. And whoso hath surrendered to Allah, such have taken the right path purposefully.",And that among us some have submitted to God while some of us are unjust tyrants — on account of their disbelief. So whoever has submitted to God those are the ones who seek right guidance.
The Jinn,72,15,"And as for those who are unjust, they are firewood for hell.",And as for those are unjust they will be firewood fuel for Hell!” ’ annā annahum and annahu totalling all twelve instances above including innahu ta‘ālā and annā minnā’l-muslimūna and what comes in between them may be read with a kasra sc. innā innahum etc. indicating a new sentence every time or with a fatha sc. annā annahum etc. indicating the statement that will follow as a relative clause.
The Jinn,72,16,"If they (the idolaters) tread the right path, We shall give them to drink of water in abundance",God exalted be He says the following about the Meccan disbelievers And it has been revealed to me that if they allaw softened in place of the hardened form its subject having been omitted that is to say annahum law which is a supplement to annahu istama‘a ‘that a company of jinn listened’ adopt the right path the path of submission to God We will give them abundant water to drink plenteous water from the heaven — this was after rain had been withheld from them for seven years —
The Jinn,72,17,"That We may test them thereby, and whoso turneth away from the remembrance of his Lord; He will thrust him into ever-growing torment.",so that We may try them test them therein and so know through knowledge outwardly manifested the nature of their gratitude. And whoever turns away from the remembrance of his Lord from the Qur’ān We will admit him naslukhu or read first person yaslukhu ‘He will admit him’ into a tortuous chastisement.
The Jinn,72,18,"And the places of worship are only for Allah, so pray not unto anyone along with Allah.",And it has been revealed to me that the places of prayer belong to God so do not invoke in them anyone along with God by associating others with Him like the Jews and Christians do who when they enter their churches and temples they ascribe partners to God.
The Jinn,72,19,"And when the slave of Allah stood up in prayer to Him, they crowded on him, almost stifling.",And that annahu; or innahu as a new sentence the pronoun being that of the matter when the servant of God the Prophet Muhammad (s) rose to invoke Him to worship Him at Batn Nakhla they that is the jinn listening to his recitation were almost upon him in heaps libadan or lubadan the plural of libda or lubda like felt in the way they were heaped on top of one another crowding in their eagerness to listen to the Qur’ān.
The Jinn,72,20,"Say (unto them, O Muhammad): I pray unto Allah only, and ascribe unto Him no partner.",He said in response to the disbelievers saying ‘Abandon this affair of yours!’ a variant reading for qāla ‘he said’ has qul ‘Say’ ‘I invoke only my Lord as God and I do not associate anyone with Him’.
The Jinn,72,21,Say: Lo! I control not hurt nor benefit for you.,Say ‘I truly have no power to bring you any harm to lead you astray or any guidance’ any good.
The Jinn,72,22,"Say: Lo! none can protect me from Allah, nor can I find any refuge beside Him",Say ‘Indeed none shall protect me from God from His chastisement were I to disobey Him and I shall never find besides Him that is other than Him any refuge.
The Jinn,72,23,"(Mine is) but conveyance (of the Truth) from Allah, and His messages; and whoso disobeyeth Allah and His messenger, lo! his is fire of hell, wherein such dwell for ever.",I have power to bring you only a communication illā balāghan is excepted from the direct object clause of amliku ‘I have power to bring’ that is to say I have power only to communicate the Message to you from God that is on His behalf and His Messages wa-risālātihi is a supplement to balāghan ‘a communication’; what comes between the excepted clause and the clause from which it is excepted is a parenthetical statement intended to emphasise the preclusion of the Prophet’s ‘ability to bring them anything else’. And whoever disobeys God and His Messenger concerning the affirmation of His Oneness and hence does not believe — indeed there will be for him the fire of Hell abiding khālidīna is a circumstantial qualifier referring to the person indicated by man ‘whoever’ in lahu ‘for him’ taking into account its plural import; it khālidīna is also an implied circumstantial qualifier in other words they shall enter it with their abiding having been preordained therein forever’.
The Jinn,72,24,Till (the day) when they shall behold that which they are promised (they may doubt); but then they will know (for certain) who is weaker in allies and less in multitude.,Such that when they see hattā is for inceptiveness but also entailing a purposive sense to an implied preceding clause that is to say they persist in their disbelief until they come to see … what they are promised of chastisement they will then know at the moment that it befalls them either on the day of Badr or on the Day of Resurrection who is weaker in supporters and fewer in numbers in assistants is it them or the believers — according to the former reading? Or is it Me or them according to the latter. Some of them said ‘When will this promise be fulfilled?’ whereupon the following was revealed
The Jinn,72,25,"Say (O Muhammad, unto the disbelievers): I know not whether that which ye are promised is nigh, or if my Lord hath set a distant term for it.",Say ‘I do not know if what you are promised of chastisement is near or if my Lord has set a distant length for it an extent and a term which only He knows.

The Jinn,72,27,"Save unto every messenger whom He hath chosen, and then He maketh a guard to go before him and a guard behind him",except to a messenger of whom He approves. Then in addition to disclosing to him what He will to disclose of it by way of making it a miracle for him He despatches He appoints and sends forth before him namely the Messenger and behind him watchers angels to preserve him until He has conveyed it to him as part of the entire revelation
The Jinn,72,28,"That He may know that they have indeed conveyed the messages of their Lord. He surroundeth all their doings, and He keepeth count of all things.",so that He God may know by knowledge outwardly manifested that an softened in place of the hardened form that is to say annahu they that is the messengers have conveyed the Messages of their Lord the plural person of the verb ablaghū ‘they have conveyed’ takes into account the plural implication of man ‘whom’ and He encompasses all that is with them wa-ahāta bimā ladayhim is a supplement to an implied clause that is to say so He has knowledge of that and keeps count of all things’ ‘adadan ‘count’ is for specification; it is transformed from a direct object sc. ‘adada originally ahsā ‘adada kulli shay’in ‘He keeps count of all things’.

He knoweth that there are sick folk among you, while others travel in the land in search of Allah’s bounty, and others (still) are fighting for the cause of Allah. So recite of it that which is easy (for you), and establish worship and pay the poor-due, and (so) lend unto Allah a goodly loan. Whatsoever good ye send before you for your souls, ye will find it with Allah, better and greater in the recompense. And seek forgiveness of Allah. Lo! Allah is Forgiving, Merciful.",Assuredly your Lord knows that you stand vigil less than two thirds of the night or at times a half of it or a third of it if read wa-nisfihi wa-thuluthihi then these constitute a supplement to thuluthay ‘two thirds’; if read wa-nisfahu wa-thuluthahu then a supplement to adnā ‘less than’ — his keeping vigil in the way mentioned is in accordance with what was enjoined on him at the beginning of this sūra — along with a group of those with you wa-tā’ifatun mina’lladhīna ma‘aka constitutes a supplement to the subject of the verb taqūmu ‘you stand vigil’ but it may also constitute although it is not certain a separating clause. The keeping vigil by some of his companions in this way indicates their emulation of him. Some of them could not tell how much of the night they had spent in prayer and how much of it had remained and would therefore keep vigil all night as a precaution; and so they used to keep vigil in this way for a whole year or more with their feet swollen until God alleviated matters for them. He exalted be He says and God keeps measures He keeps count of the night and the day. He knows that an softened in place of the hardened form its subject having been omitted that is to say annahu you will not be able to keep count of it that is the length of the night so that you may perform the vigil at the time in which it is required unless you stay up all night which is hard on you and so He has relented to you making you revert to what is easier. So recite as much as is feasible of the Qur’ān during prayer by performing as much prayer as is feasible. He knows that an softened in place of the hardened form that is to say annahu some of you will be sick while others will be travelling in the land seeking the bounty of God seeking of His provision through commerce and otherwise and others will be fighting in the way of God for each of the three groups mentioned the keeping of nightly vigil is hard and so God has alleviated things for them by enjoining on them what is feasible.

The Dawn,89,17,"Nay, but ye (for your part) honour not the orphan",No indeed! — a disavowal of this notion in other words honour is not about wealth nor is there any humiliation in poverty rather it has to do with obedience and disobedience respectively; but the disbelievers of Mecca unmindful of this.

The Night,92,16,He who denieth and turneth away.,he who denies the Prophet and turns away from faith — this delimiting of those who deserve to enter this fire constitutes an interpretation of His saying But He forgives other than that to whomever He will Q. 448 which in turn suggests that what is meant is that entry into the Fire which will be everlasting.
The Night,92,17,Far removed from it will be the righteous,The God-fearing one al-atqā means al-taqī shall be spared it he will be removed far away from it

Both explanations apply to the evil of the mentioned Labīd and his daughters; the objection to the first opinion is that humans do not ‘whisper’ in the hearts of other humans but that it is the jinn who whisper in their hearts I would respond by saying that human beings also ‘whisper’ in a manner appropriate to them beginning externally whereafter their whispers reach the heart and establish themselves in it in the way in which this customarily happens. But God knows best what is correct and to Him shall be the return and the final destination and may God bless our Master Muhammad and his family and Companions and grant them all much peace forever and always. God suffices for us and what an excellent guardian is He! And there is no power or might except in God the Sublime the Tremendous.
